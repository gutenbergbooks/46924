<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smaller">HE</span> substance of the following
pages was delivered in February last in a series of six lectures at The University
College of Wales, Aberystwyth. In volume form the matter has been somewhat
re-arranged and the latter part expanded.</p>

<p>So many attempts have been made during the last century and a quarter
to locate the Aryan cradle and to trace the wanderings of the Wiros,
that it may be considered presumptuous for the author to venture on a
further suggestion. He can only plead that most of the previous attempts
have been made by philologists, usually with little or no arch√¶ological
experience, while the discoveries of the last quarter of a century have
placed the inquirer to-day in a position which is vastly superior to
that of most of his predecessors. The evolution and distribution of the
leaf-shaped swords seem to provide a crucial test by which to gauge the
value of previous suggestions.</p>

<p>The author has felt that it would be for the convenience of the reader
if he reduced the footnotes at the bottom of the page to the smallest
possible dimensions, while describing each work quoted very fully in
the bibliography at the end of the volume. In many cases, where the
subject matter does not form the basis of his argument and the fact is
not in dispute, he has thought that it would be more useful to quote
a recent and readily accessible volume, preferably in English, in
which authorities are fully cited, than to include all the original
authorities in the notes and bibliography. This applies specially to
Chapter II, and to some extent to those immediately following.</p>

<p>The author would like to take this opportunity of thanking his many
friends, who have so kindly placed their knowledge and experience at
his disposal, especially the Principal and other authorities of The
University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, for inviting him to deliver
the lectures, and Professors H. J. Fleure and H. J. Rose. He wishes
also to thank the Rev. Professor A. H. Sayce, Professor W. M. Flinders
Petrie and Miss M. A. Murray, who have sent him valuable notes, Mr. E.
Sharwood Smith for much help with classical references, Professor J.
L. Myres and Dr. S. Singer for many helpful suggestions. Especially
are his thanks due to Mr. J. H. Le Rougetil, for procuring drawings
of swords from the Buda-Pest Museum, to Sir Arthur Evans, Dr. A. J.
B. Wace and Mr. S. Casson for photographs and drawings from Crete and
Athens, to Dr. W. &#352;mid and Dr. F. Neumann for sketches and notes on
the specimens at Graz and Laibach, and above all to Dr. Adolf Mahr, of
the Naturhistorisches Museum at Vienna, for drawings of the swords and
other objects in his museum and for an immense amount of help in other
ways. He wishes also to thank the authorities of various museums for
permission to publish drawings of specimens in their collections, and
the Trustees of the British Museum for allowing him to reproduce Plate
III.</p>

<p>These are only some of the many kind friends who have given him
assistance and who have helped him with suggestions and in verifying
references. To all these he returns his grateful thanks. He wishes also
to acknowledge the great help afforded to him by the officials of the
London Library, the Society of Antiquaries, the Royal Anthropological
Institute, the Hellenic Society and the Royal Asiatic Society, and to
take this opportunity of thanking them for their unvarying courtesy.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_I" id="Chapter_I"></a>C<span class="smaller">HAPTER</span> I<br />

<span class="s5">THE PROBLEM</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">F<span class="smaller">OR</span> the last fifteen hundred
years the Celtic tongues have been spoken
only in the extreme north-west of Europe, in parts of Ireland, the west
of Scotland, and the Isle of Man, in Wales, Cornwall and Brittany,
and for some little time these languages have ceased to be spoken in
Cornwall and the Isle of Man.</p>

<p>But we have ample evidence that these tongues had once a wider range,
and were pushed westward in the first instance by the spread of Roman
culture and the Latin language as the empire increased its bounds, and
still more by the Teutonic tribes who invaded the western half of that
empire and brought about its fall.</p>

<p>If however we examine the evidence which has come down to us from the
first century before the Christian era, especially such material as has
been furnished by C√¶sar and Strabo, we shall find that languages of the
Celtic type were spoken at that time throughout all Europe west of the
Rhine and north of the Pyrenees and the southern slopes of the Alps. We
shall note also that these tongues were spoken in many parts of Spain
and in North Italy, though in both these areas they were of relatively
late introduction.</p>

<p>Again there is another area in which Celtic speech was in use at that
time, or had been shortly before. This is the mountain or Alpine zone of
Central Europe, as far east, at least, as a line drawn from Cracow to
Agram. It is possible, too, that such tongues may have been spoken at
one time still further east.</p>

<p>The problem before us is to inquire first in what region the Celtic
tongues originated, then how and when they spread to the areas in which
we find them two thousand years ago. To do this we shall have to review
the condition of these areas both from the standpoint of prehistoric
arch√¶ology and physical anthropology, to see whether the evidence
derived from these sciences, taken together with that drawn from
comparative philology and the study of place-names, can help us to reach
a solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>But the problem is further complicated by the fact that the Celtic
languages fall into two groups. In the one occurs the sound <em>qu</em>, which
has in later days become a hard <em>c</em>, while in the other this sound has
become labialised and converted into a <em>p</em> or <em>b</em>. It has been thought
by some that the <em>qu</em> peoples, spoken of usually as Goidels or Gaels,
arrived first from the common Celtic home, and that the <em>p</em> peoples,
called Brythons or Cymri, came later from the same centre; this view is,
however, strenuously denied by others. We have, therefore, to determine
if we can, not only whence and when the Celtic languages arrived in the
west, but whether they came in one, two or more waves.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="fig_01" name="fig_01"></a>

      alt="Celtic Cradle"
      title="Celtic Lands and Celtic Cradle" />

<p class="caption">FIG. 1.&mdash;CELTIC LANDS AND THE CELTIC CRADLE.</p>
</div>

<p>Lastly, we find that the Celtic tongues, as spoken to-day, contain
elements of grammar and syntax, and not a few words too, which divide
them off sharply from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> groups of languages to which they are
in other respects akin. Also it is believed by some that non-Celtic
languages, such as Pictish, survived in this region until relatively
late times, while it is well-known that a primitive non-Celtic tongue,
the Basque, is still spoken in the fastnesses of the Pyrenees. It is
important, therefore, if we are to have before us all the factors which
enter into the problem, that we should inquire what people were here
before the first Celts arrived, and that we should make ourselves to
some extent familiar with all the different races and cultures which
preceded the Celtic invaders.</p>

<p>If we pass across England and Wales from east to west, and the same
is almost as true if we cross Scotland, we find, first of all that
the population is mainly tall and fair, while as we proceed we come
across elements which are darker and shorter, until in Wales and the
West Highlands we find the majority of the people are small brunettes
of slender build. This dark type is also to be met with in Ireland,
especially in the west, the part of that island in which the Erse
language has best survived.</p>

<p>It is because the Celtic tongues, whether <em>qu</em> or <em>p</em>, are spoken
chiefly by people of this small brunette type, that it is frequently
called the Celtic race, and yet all the evidence of ancient authorities
goes to show that 2,000 or 2,500 years ago the Celts were looked upon as
a tall, fair people.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Here is another difficulty which must be taken
into consideration as we make our inquiries, for no solution can be
considered sound which cannot, without straining the evidence, answer
all these questions.</p>

<p>As we have seen the main areas which were Celtic-speaking in the time
of C√¶sar were the British Isles and Gaul, west of the Rhine; these I
shall term Celtic lands, leaving out Spain and Cis-alpine Gaul as areas
into which the Celtic invasion arrived at a relatively late date. Now,
besides these Celtic lands Celtic tongues were spoken in the Alpine
zone, and perhaps at one time still further east. It is from this area
that the Celtic languages have been thought by some to have entered the
lands of the west. They cannot have been introduced from Spain or Italy,
into which they were late entrants, but it has been suggested by some
writers that they arrived from the north-east, from the Baltic region.
It is true that there is some slight evidence that Celtic place-names
have existed in this area, but the balance of evidence, as I shall hope
to show, seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> prove that Celtic people arrived there relatively
late and not in large numbers, and that they were never the dominant
people of that region. There remains only the Alpine zone and the lands
to the east of it. This area, from the Jura to the Iron Gates, from the
northern slopes of the Carpathians to the southern foot-hills of the
Alps, I shall term the Celtic cradle, and I trust that the evidence
which I shall produce will convince my readers that I am correct in so
doing.</p>

C<span class="smaller">HAPTER</span> II<br />

<span class="s5">THE FIRST INHABITANTS OF CELTIC LANDS</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">O<span class="smaller">F</span> the earliest inhabitants
of Celtic lands we know little or nothing.
We have, it is true, a number of tools made of flaked flint, but they
tell us little of the men who fashioned them. In spite of the recent
admissions by the eminent French arch√¶ologists who have examined the
new discoveries at Foxhall,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> there is still no little difference of
opinion as to the human workmanship<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of rostro-carinates, eoliths and
such like early attempts, and no human remains have come to light which
can be attributed with any probability to this horizon.</p>

<p>When we come to what is usually termed the lower pal√¶olithic period we
are on surer ground, for no one now denies the origin of implements of
the Chelles and St. Acheul types. But the only skeletal remains which
can with certainty be attributed to this period are the human jaw from
the Mauer sand-pit near Heidelberg,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and the famous Piltdown skull.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Few people now believe that the Galley Hill skeleton dates from so
remote a time,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> while the discoverer himself has disclaimed so early
an origin for the Ipswich man.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>To attempt to reconstruct a human type from a mandible alone would be
indeed to carry far the principle of <em>ex pede Herculem</em>, and as yet
there is little agreement among anthropologists as to the exact date,
or for that matter the exact reconstruction, of the Piltdown skull,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
though the ingenious hypothesis that a unique human cranium without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> a
jaw, was found in close association with a unique troglodyte mandible
has now, I understand, definitely been abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Thus little or nothing is known of the first inhabitants of Celtic
lands, beyond their tools, but when we come to the middle pal√¶olithic
period the case is different. While some difference of opinion still
exists, the view advanced by Obermaier<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and others seems to be
gaining ground, that in Celtic lands the industry of Le Moustier first
appeared as the climate was becoming colder on the approach of the last
or W√ºrm glaciation, though it is thought by some that it had flourished
in an earlier and warmer time in the regions lying to the east.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This
industry is believed by most authorities to have survived the first
W√ºrm maximum and to have lasted through the temporary amelioration of
the Laufen retreat. Whether it survived, too, the second maximum, and
lasted until the climate definitely improved is more doubtful, but many
arch√¶ologists of great repute believe that it did so,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and unless
this was the case it will be difficult to explain certain features of
the Audi flints.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Though there is as yet no general agreement as to the duration of the
Mousterian industry, it is different when we come to consider the type
of man who was responsible for this work. Everyone is agreed that the
authors of this culture were of the type known as Neanderthal man,
for several skeletons of this type, or parts of them, have been found
associated with flint implements of Le Moustier design, and none
have as yet turned up under conditions which make this correlation
impossible.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>A considerable number of skulls and skeletons, about two dozen in all,
of Neanderthal man have been found, the great majority in Celtic lands;
but, though there is a general resemblance between all the members of
the series, sufficiently strong to mark them off from the Piltdown
skull on the one hand and from modern men on the other, the type is in
many respects very variable. There are vast differences observable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
between the skull from Chapelle-aux-Saints,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the highest form yet
discovered, and that of the Gibraltar man,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> or rather woman, which
is the most primitive yet found in Europe. As far as one can judge from
the descriptions which have appeared as I write, the skull recently
found at Broken Hill in Rhodesia differs from that of Gibraltar hardly
if at all more than the Gibraltar skull differs from that found at
Chapelle-aux-Saints. In the latter case there are several intermediate
forms, in the former such may yet turn up, for Africa has, as yet,
produced but one other skull of this type, that found not long ago near
Constantine in Algeria, no description of which has, I believe, yet been
published.</p>

<p>Skulls of this type have been so frequently described,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> individually
and collectively, that it is unnecessary to give another detailed
account. It will be sufficient to say that they are large and massive,
the vault is low, and they are specially distinguished by having over
the eye sockets a heavy and continuous projecting ridge, known as a
<em>torus</em>, which is one of the distinguishing features of the large
anthropoid apes. Another point of importance is that the head was so
attached to the body that it could not have been held absolutely erect,
and must have produced a slouching gait, though the degree of this slope
varied considerably in different specimens, and in the case of the
Rhodesian skull was quite halfway between the slope of the Gibraltar
skull and that of the gorilla.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>But it is unnecessary for our purpose to pursue this question further,
for with the arrival of modern man, after the last glaciation was
past, Neanderthal man disappeared. That the two races met, though not
necessarily in this continent, seems clear from the fact that at Audi,
near Les Eyzies, in the Dordogne, we find a culture, which in some
respects resembles that of Le Moustier, and in others the succeeding
culture of Aurignac.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> That these two races interbred is unlikely,
for Neanderthal man must have appeared an unsightly beast to his modern
successor. In any case, if mating did take place, the union must
have been sterile, for, in spite of much that has been written to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the contrary,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, there is no clear evidence of the survival of any
distinctive Neanderthal traits in the men of later days.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The second maximum of the W√ºrm glaciation seems to have culminated
about 15,000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and about that time, or conceivably
earlier, modern man first arrived in North Africa, if we may judge by
the appearance of a fresh type of flint industry, known usually as
Capsian.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Whence he came is uncertain. It has been suggested that he
may have reached the north from tropical Africa,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> but no evidence
has been adduced in support of this hypothesis. It seems more likely
that he came from Asia, probably by means of the Sinaitic peninsula,
or possibly across the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. This much is certain;
about this time the Capsian culture is found extending along the north
of the continent, from Egypt as far west at any rate as Algeria, and
perhaps beyond, though at no point but one is it found far from the
Mediterranean coast.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The one exception is in Egypt, where implements
of this type have been found as far south as Luxor,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> so that we
may be satisfied that modern man in his earliest movements passed
up the Nile valley at least as far as the First Cataract. It would
seem probable that in Egypt the invaders came into touch with their
Neanderthal predecessors, who retreated before them up the Nile valley
towards Luxor, where Dr. Seligman has found implements of Le Moustier
type more developed than any discovered elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>; it is possible
that some retreated further south and may even have reached Rhodesia.</p>

<p>Other of these Neanderthal refugees seem to have gone westward, and
perhaps passed up the Italian land-bridge to western Europe; if so it
was probably these, who had come into contact with the Capsian culture
of North Africa, who were responsible for the Audi industry. They were
followed before long by the invaders, and in Celtic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> lands at least were
soon exterminated, though it is just possible that they survived to a
later date further east.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The culture of the newcomers is known as that of Aurignac, and seems
to have started in Europe about 12,500 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> A great many
skeletons of this period have been discovered and described, and though
all of these show us men very like those of the present day, there is a
considerable range of variation among them.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The skulls of the upper
pal√¶olithic periods, apart from the Chancelade skull<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> to be discussed
later, may be divided into three marked groups, though it is well to
remember that there is no strict uniformity among all the members of
each group. All the skulls of this period, however, are long, for the
broad-headed type, so prevalent in Central Europe to-day, did not arrive
until the closing phase.</p>

<p>Of the first of these three groups we have only two examples, the mother
and son from the Grotte des Enfants, near Mentone.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> But as these are
the earliest in date, and differ in some respects very markedly from
the remainder, they have been distinguished by the name of the Grimaldi
race, after the owner of the cave, the Prince of Monaco.</p>

<p>This type was small, being less than 5 ft. 3 in. in height, the skulls
were of the long variety, having length-breadth indices of 68.5 and
69.2, and the jaws and teeth project, so that they exhibit a character
known as prognathism. This latter character has caused the race to
be termed negroid, and unjustifiable deductions have been drawn from
this term. It has been shown, however, that there is no reason for
supposing any affinity between this type and the negro race of tropical
Africa.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Both of these skeletons were found in a contracted position,
and that of the boy was covered with red ochre.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Our second group is the Cromagnon, and is based largely on the skeletons
found in the cave of Cromagnon, near Les Eyzies. By many anthropologists
this term is used to cover all the skeletons from this period except
those of the Grimaldi type, but more recently it has been shown that
all these remains cannot conveniently be placed in one group, for the
distinguishing characters are but faintly visible in some and totally
absent from a large number.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The term is now becoming used in a more
restricted sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The Cromagnon type is tall. The men were often 5 ft. 10 in. or 5 ft. 11
in. high, though the women were frequently much shorter. Their heads
were large, larger than the average in Europe to-day, but not very high;
they were long as compared with their breadth, having a cranial index
of about 74; their noses were narrow, but their faces were short and
relatively broad. This combination of a long head and a short face is
unusual, and is called disharmonic, and this disharmony is one of the
most striking characteristics of Cromagnon man.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>It is often thought that this disharmonic trait, the long head and the
short face, is evidence of the mixed ancestry of the race which exhibits
it,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and if this were the case we might expect Cromagnon man to be
the result of a crossing of two other races. There is no other evidence
to indicate that this was the case, and if such crossing had occurred,
it seems likely that it took place before the Cromagnon type reached
Europe.</p>

<p>It seems probable that it is to the men of the Cromagnon type that we
must attribute the beginnings of that art, which reached its finest
development in a later age, and has provided the most conspicuous as
well as the most pleasing feature of the upper pal√¶olithic culture.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Lastly we have the type represented by Br√ºnn I., Br√ºx, Lautsch, Combe
Capelle, Barma Grande (one of the skulls from B.G. now in the Mus√©e de
Menton, but not the skulls generally known as B.G. 1 and 2), the woman
from the upper layer in the Grotte des Enfants, the <em>Calotte du gravier
de fond</em> at Grenelle, the Denise fragments, as well as by one or two
skulls of the transition period from pal√¶olithic to neolithic found at
Ofnet (No. 21, i.) and a few of those belonging to the same period found
at Mugem. The type is usually high-headed as well as narrow-headed,
and tends to have the orbits horizontally lengthened, the glabella and
supraciliaries strong, the fore-head retreating, the nose broad and
the upper jaw projecting (alveolar prognathism). The cephalic index is
usually between 68 and 72; the stature is moderate or low.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Thus we find during the period of Aurignac three groups of long-headed
men, the Grimaldi, Cromagnon and Combe Capelle, and, especially on the
Riviera, in the Barma Grande cave and the Grotte des Enfants, skulls
which show various apparent combinations of these types, while at
Solutr√© and Laugerie Basse we find the last type showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> modifications
to some extent towards the characteristics of modern men. These types
and intermixed types occupied west and central Europe, so far as it was
habitable during the later pal√¶olithic periods, and the combinations
of Combe Capelle and Cromagnon characters in the skulls of Obercassel
(Magdalenian period) is noteworthy. The earliest in point of time is
the Grimaldi, which has been found only near Mentone, and there are
reasons for believing that its distribution lay around the western
Mediterranean, then an inland sea. This view is supported by the fact
that marked alveolar prognathism has been noted among the natives of
Algeria and Morocco, and I am told that it is not uncommonly met with
in Spain; it is also very marked in Portugal, though here it has been
attributed to a different cause. It is, however, of old standing in
that country, as it has been noted among the skulls from Mugem,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
which are believed to date from the close of the pal√¶olithic age. A
similar feature has been noted in some of the skulls from the Algerian
dolmens.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>To the Cromagnon type, pure, it is difficult to ascribe any other skulls
besides those from Cromagnon, and those from Lafaye Bruniquel, but some
of the Cromagnon characters are well shown in some Barma Grande skulls.
The type is said to survive in the Dordogne and perhaps near the western
Pyrenees in North Spain at the present day.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The Combe Capelle or
Br√ºnn type, is seen to have occurred on the whole more to the north and
east, and seems rather to focus in Central Europe and the southern part
of the North German plain. It was probably the latest to arrive on the
scene, for it is associated only with remains of late Aurignac type, and
has been more frequently found in the succeeding Solutr√© period.</p>

<p>Thus we see that by the close of the period of Aurignac, about 11,000
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, we have three groups of long-headed men in Celtic lands,
and that, though they overlap, they are tending to obtain for themselves
definite areas of distribution.</p>

<p>During the closing years of the Aurignacian period the climate had been
getting milder and perhaps drier, and steppe conditions prevailed over
much of France and still more further east. Herds of horses arrived and
were hunted for food and the <em>saiga</em>, a kind of antelope, was found
as far south as the Dordogne, if not beyond, during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> succeeding
Solutrean period. These Steppe conditions are more characteristic of the
latter period,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> when France was invaded by a new people, not given,
as far as we know, to artistic efforts, but who were able to fashion
very skilfully made weapons of flint to aid them in chasing the beasts
of the steppe.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The fact that skulls of our third group the Combe
Capelle, are more common during this period and have only been found
during the later phases of the previous age, when, as we have seen,
steppe conditions were already approaching, leads us to suspect that it
is to this type of man that we must attribute the invasion of Celtic
lands which took place at this time. The Cromagnon men seem to have
retreated to the south-west and to have taken refuge in the fastnesses
of the Pyrenees,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> while the invading hunters dominated the southern
part, at least, of the Celtic lands.</p>

<p>But towards 9,500 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> the climate began again to deteriorate,
and the steppe conditions passed gradually to those of tundra. The
steppe animals retreated to the east, towards South Russia and
Turkestan, and most of the men of Solutr√©, who hunted them for food,
seem to have followed in their wake. It seems doubtful whether the
Solutrean invasion reached Britain, though implements of this type are
said to have been found here,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and Proto-Solutrean stations are
reported as occurring in England.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> It has been claimed recently
that this type reached the south of Sweden,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> but this view is not
generally accepted in that country.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>On the departure of the Solutrean invaders the remnant of the
aborigines, who had fled to the mountains in the south-west, and there
developed their art to a much greater pitch of perfection, now returned
to France, and once again, as the men of La Madeleine, became the
dominant race in Celtic lands. It seems possible that some of their
comrades had fled north to Britain on the arrival of the men of Solutr√©,
and had survived there throughout this period, for, though no industry
has been found in the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> Isles which can accurately be described
as that of La Madeleine,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> in the strict French meaning of that term,
we do find traces of the culture of Aurignac, persisting perhaps until
still later times.</p>

<p>It must not be thought, however, that the Combe Capelle race never
reached these isles. Whether the culture of Solutr√© did so or not seems
uncertain, but some of the skeletons which have been found here have
been classed with the Combe Capelle group.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> But, as we have seen,
this race was present in France, at any rate in some parts of that
country, for some little time before the arrival of the men with the
culture of Solutr√©.</p>

<p>The colder climate of the Magdalenian period has been shown to coincide
with the B√ºhl advance of the Alpine glaciers,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> which reached its
maximum about 7,500 to 7,000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> After that the climate slowly
improved, though the precipitation increased, and forests sprang up on
the hitherto open lands. As the tundra conditions in Celtic lands gave
way to forest, the reindeer migrated to the north and north-east, while
their place was taken by the red deer. As the forests developed it
became increasingly difficult for men to traverse great distances or to
intermingle as freely as they had done before. There was a tendency for
separate groups to develop in different regions; so that, when we arrive
at the next period, the Azilian, we find very different types of people
in various parts of Europe.</p>

<p>Even before the close of the Magdalenian period a fresh type had
arrived, apparently from the north, if we may judge from the skeleton
found at Chancelade in the Dordogne. This skeleton bears a close
resemblance to those of the modern Eskimos,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and since the latter
have retained a type of art reminiscent of certain phases of Magdalenian
culture,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> we may suspect that Chancelade men, following the departing
reindeer, passed north-eastward to the tundra of Siberia.</p>

<p>It was between 7,000 and 6,500 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> that a fresh wave of
Capsian people from North Africa began to invade Spain,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> into which
peninsula they introduced what is known as East Spanish Art.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> By
degrees they pressed the Magdalenian Cromagnons to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> Pyrenees,
where their culture declined to that which we know as Azilian.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
The invaders passed on through Celtic lands, bringing with them a new
culture, known as Tardenoisian,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and seem to have reached the British
Isles before 5000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span></p>

<p>These people seem to have been another variety of the same long-headed
race, which had developed into a distinct type in North Africa, and
had there, perhaps, mingled to a greater or lesser degree with the
descendants of the Grimaldi men, whom we met with at the beginning of
the period of Aurignac. If we may judge by those who seem to be their
descendants, they were of rather short, slight build, with long narrow
heads, brown skin, dark hair and eyes, the type which to-day is known as
the Mediterranean race.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> It is possible that the Grimaldi elements
in their composition, and which are sometimes found comparatively pure,
may account for that small dark type, often showing marked alveolar
prognathism, which has been found in certain out of the way regions,
such as Apulia and Sardinia, and which are known to some anthropologists
as Iapygian,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and have been termed Ethiopic by Ruggeri.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>This new population seems to have been peaceably inclined and made
no attempt to exterminate its predecessors, but settled down in the
lower lands and by the sea shore, while the Cromagnon men remained in
the mountain zones of the Pyrenees and the Dordogne, and the Combe
Capelle type survived in Central Europe and among the hills of Wales.
It seems almost certain that the newcomers were still hunters, quite
ignorant of agriculture and the domestication of animals; as some of
their settlements have been found by the sea shore and on the banks of
streams, it seems likely that they lived to a considerable extent on
fish and molluscs.</p>

<p>It would appear, then, that the type which we know as the Mediterranean
race, and which has given to Wales, Scotland and Ireland the majority
of their small brunette inhabitants, is made up of the descendants of
all the types of long-headed men&mdash;except the Chancelade variety&mdash;which
we meet with in the Celtic lands of western Europe during the upper
pal√¶olithic period. That the Combe Capelle type survives on the
moorlands of Plynlimmon has been shown by Fleure: examples of an
africanoid type with alveolar prognathism are not uncommon in Wales and
in the poorer quarters of our big cities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> and the Cromagnon type only
seems to be missing or at any rate relatively scarce. The main element,
however, which has gone to make up the Mediterranean race as we now know
it, seems to be that which entered Europe through Spain, with Capsian
culture, during the closing years of the Magdalenian period.</p>

<p>These people have left in the west, not only considerable vestiges of
their blood, but no small amount of their language, or to state the
matter more accurately the language of these people has left a marked
effect upon the tongues which succeeded it in the west. More than twenty
years ago Mr., now Sir John Morris Jones<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> pointed out that &ldquo;the
syntax of Welsh and Irish differs in some important respects from that
of the languages belonging to the other branches of the Aryan family,&rdquo;
and suggested that these points, in which too the neo-celtic tongues
differed from ancient Gaulish, were due to the influence of a language
which had been spoken in these lands before the introduction of the
Celtic tongue. He pointed out that many of these peculiarities, which
occur also sometimes when the English tongue is spoken by Irishmen,
were similar to the syntactical arrangements in force in the language
of ancient Egypt and among the Berber dialects spoken by the natives of
Algeria, the Kabyles, Shawiya and Tuaregs.</p>

<p>Now the Egyptians and other peoples of North Africa are considered
by all anthropologists as typical members of the Mediterranean race,
though the inhabitants of the western part seem, as we have seen, to
have incorporated no small amount of Grimaldi blood; it would seem
then that we may accept the suggestion of Sir John Morris Jones that
the syntax of Welsh and Irish is a legacy from the language spoken by
these Mediterranean invaders, who reached Spain about 7000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>
and formed the bulk of the population of the British Isles about 5000
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span></p>

<p>So far we have been dealing with the early inhabitants of the Celtic
lands of the west, but a word must be said of some fresh arrivals into
the Celtic cradle in Central Europe. It was during the Azilian period,
about 6000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, that a new race appeared in Central Europe,
coming from the east. Of their earlier abode we know nothing positively,
but there are reasons for inferring that their line of approach was by
the Kopet Dagh and the Armenian highlands, and that they came ultimately
from the slopes of the Hindu Kush and the western side of the Himalayan
<em>massif</em>. This race,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> which is called the race of Ofnet, from the skulls
found in the caves of Ofnet, in Bavaria, had a broad head, the outline
of which as viewed from above consisted of two segments of circles, the
one forming the back of the head, the other the front. The brow-ridges
are slight, the nose short and straight, the eye-sockets low and almost
rectangular, the cheek-bones not very prominent and the chin weak and
undeveloped.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> This race seems to have met and mated with the remnants
of the Combe Capelle race in the Upper Danube basin, and the progeny of
this union seems to have been a type with a pear-shaped head as seen
from above, with a rounded back, indistinguishable from the type found
later in the Swiss lake-dwellings and in the mountains of Central Europe
at the present day, and which is known as the Alpine race.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The Ofnet race seems to have spread westward into the Celtic lands,
either at this time or perhaps later, though probably in small numbers,
for a skull found at Grenelle, near Paris, under what are believed to
be neolithic surroundings, belongs to this type.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Other broad-headed
skulls of this or the Alpine type, dating from about 5000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>,
or a little earlier, have been found at Mugem on the banks of the
Tagus,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> while others of this type of about the same date have been
found in the caves of Furfooz in Belgium.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Whether any of this broad-headed Asiatic strain reached the British
Isles at so early a date is uncertain. No skulls of this type and
date have been discovered, but broad-headed types occur sporadically
in Wales, Ireland and the western islands of Scotland, which may
conceivably represent descendants of early Ofnet or Alpine immigrants.</p>

<p>Somewhat later, before 4000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, fresh waves of broad-headed
immigrants seem to have arrived in Central Europe from the Armenian
highlands or the Anatolian plateau, bringing with them the knowledge
of grain, cultivated fruits and domestic animals, and the custom of
erecting pile-dwellings in marshes or lakes, and of grinding and
polishing axes of flint or other hard stone.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Such knowledge seems to
have reached even the west of Switzerland by 4000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> and to
have spread later throughout the <em>massif central</em> of France, which was
already peopled by men of the Alpine type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>But the art of polishing hard stone spread further than the people who
were responsible for its introduction, and during the next few centuries
this art had become well known throughout the Celtic lands of the west;
the need for more efficient tools to fight the encroaching woodland
must have encouraged this art. How far the elements of agriculture
had travelled with the art of grinding axes seems uncertain, for few,
if any, unquestionable neolithic dwelling sites of this time within
this area have been found or thoroughly explored. The scanty evidence
at our disposal seems to show, however, that the people of the west
were possessed of some domesticated animals, so that the inhabitants
of Celtic lands had passed from a purely hunting stage before 3,000
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span></p>

<p>There is one other culture, introduced into Europe perhaps by another
race, which I must not omit to mention, as it may have provided another
element, albeit a small one, in the early population of Celtic lands.
At Mullerup, in the peat moss of Maglemose, in the west of the island
of Zealand, there was found in 1900 an important dwelling site with a
very distinct culture, including harpoons and other implements of horn
and bone, which is known to Scandinavian arch√¶ologists as the Mullerup,
but to English-speaking students as the Maglemose culture.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> More
recently, in 1917, another settlement, exhibiting what appears to be
the same culture, was discovered at Sv√¶rdborg, in the south of the same
island.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>No skulls or skeletons have been found associated with this culture, and
there has been much speculation as to the race which was responsible for
it. Owing to the presence of harpoons it was first assumed that this
culture was a direct derivation from the Azilian and Magdalenian, though
it has been pointed out that the Maglemose harpoons are very different
in form from the Azilian, and resemble more nearly some found in eastern
Russia.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Still the majority of authorities treat this culture as of
Azilian origin. Others, relying largely on the resemblances of certain
elements of culture to those found at some very late Aurignacian sites
in South Poland, believe the people and the culture to have arrived from
that region.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Recently I have suggested another explanation.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
Noticing the resemblance between the Magiemose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> culture and a slightly
later civilisation known as East Scandinavian or Arctic, which has been
found at several sites associated with skulls of Mongoloid type, I have
suggested that in the Maglemose people we may perhaps see the first
arrival in Europe of that Mongoloid race, which now peoples a large part
of the north-east of the continent. My suggestion has not been well
received in Scandinavian circles, and M. Nordmann has submitted it to
very searching though courteous criticism.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> While duly appreciating
the value of all the evidence he has cited, I am still of opinion that
my view, though far from proved, meets the existing evidence as well as,
if not better than, its rivals.</p>

<p>The importance of the Maglemose problem for our purpose lies in the fact
that certain sites in the British Isles have produced an industry which
has been claimed, and perhaps rightly, to be akin to that of Mullerup
and Sv√¶rdborg. Certain discoveries in the caves at Oban and on a raised
beach on the island of Oronsay, are claimed to be of this or of Azilian
culture,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> while other finds at Holderness are said to resemble more
closely still the Maglemose culture.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> More recently still Mr. O.
G. S. Crawford has suggested that certain implements, which he and I
discovered last year at an early occupation site on the Newbury Sewage
outfall works at Thatcham, Berks., bear close resemblances to some found
at Sv√¶rdborg.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>It is too soon yet to appraise the value of these resemblances. Some
of these sites, notably those at Oronsay and Thatcham, appear on some
grounds to be somewhat later than the settlements at Mullerup and
Sv√¶rdborg. This does not, of course, disprove their cultural connection.
It is unwise, at present, to draw any positive conclusions from such
evidence, but we may note that it is possible that during late Azilian
times, or perhaps later still, fresh elements entered the British Isles
from the Baltic region, and that it is at least possible that these
elements may have been of the Mongoloid race.</p>

<p>People showing slight Mongoloid traits may be found sporadically
throughout Wales, though, as far as I can ascertain, this type has not
been noted as prevalent in any particular areas; how far it may be noted
in the west of Scotland or in Ireland I am uncertain. But we cannot be
sure that the introduction of this Mongoloid strain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> dates from so early
a time, as it is quite possible that the type may have been introduced
much later by the Vikings, who may perhaps sometimes have carried Finns
with them in their forays.</p>

<p>Though after the close of Azilian times the culture of Celtic lands
changed more than once and in more respects than one, we have at present
no reason for suspecting the introduction of fresh racial elements
before the beginning of the Bronze Age. The origin of Campignian
culture, which seems to have flourished over the northern part of Celtic
lands, in one form or another, from about 5000 to 3500 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, is
still a matter of dispute, but it is doubtful whether the solution of
the problem is likely to introduce a fresh element into the population
of the Celtic lands.</p>

<p>The vast mass of the population of this area about 3000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>
were the descendants of the long-headed populations of Europe and North
Africa in the upper pal√¶olithic period. In some parts of the south the
Cromagnon type may have persisted, in a pure or mixed form, as did the
Combe Capelle type further north, while a modified form of the Grimaldi
type was found from Portugal to Wales, especially in fishing villages.
The prevailing type seems to have been that which came latest from
Africa, and which most truly deserves the name of the Mediterranean
race, though it may be well to realise that this term, as commonly
used, seems to include all the varieties before mentioned, as well as a
modified mixture of all these long-headed types.</p>

<p>In Central France, and to a less extent elsewhere, the Alpine type had
penetrated, though it is doubtful whether it had, as yet, reached the
British Isles. And we must realise that it is just possible that some
Mongoloid peoples, from the Baltic and ultimately from Siberia, may have
made a few settlements in this country, though their numbers are not
likely to have been great.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Such then, as far as our evidence extends at present, seems to have been
the population of Celtic lands in the true neolithic age, when people
lived in small, self-contained communities, and outside commodities were
rarely met with, and then only bartered from tribe to tribe. As we shall
see, the next thousand years or so were to introduce fresh elements.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_III" id="Chapter_III"></a>
C<span class="smaller">HAPTER</span> III<br />

<span class="s5">EARLY TRADE WITH CELTIC LANDS</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">U<span class="smaller">NTIL</span> the close of the
stone age the movements of people had been
by means of gradual drifting. During the pal√¶olithic age, when the
population supported itself by hunting, the people wandered over
considerable areas in search of game, and the inhabitants of different
regions frequently met and mingled with one another. As the forest
conditions arose during the close of the Magdalenian period these
wanderings were restricted in scope, and with the gradual introduction
of domesticated animals and the practice of agriculture during the
neolithic age, more settled communities arose. Thus the different
types mixed less with one another, and the communities became more
specialised, both in type and culture, as their wanderings diminished.</p>

<p>A new method of intermixture was, however, soon to arise, as the
practice of commerce developed. It is possible that even during the
pal√¶olithic age, tribes who lived in a region where flint or other
suitable material was abundant, or who had become skilled in the
fashioning of some advanced type of implement, sometimes bartered their
spare products for other commodities. Such operations, if they did
exist, must have been very limited in extent, and confined to bartering
between neighbouring tribes.</p>

<p>During the neolithic age this simple principle of exchange continued,
though it was probably more frequent, since communities had a narrower
range, and some must have been living in regions where suitable raw
material was scarce or non-existent. Some well favoured regions also
had begun to develop regular commerce. The inhabitants of the island
of Santorin, the ancient Melos, had before metal was known organised
an export trade in obsidian goods, for they held a monopoly of that
excellent volcanic glass in the √Ügean region<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. It seems likely, too,
that the people of the Lipari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> islands traded in the same material with
south Italy, Sicily and Malta.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Some of the natives of the French
department of Indre-et-Loire, finding themselves possessed of great
quantities of beautiful honey-coloured flint in the neighbourhood of Le
Grand-Pressigny, exported implements, both finished and in the rough, to
many distant places in France,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and the same is probably true of the
dwellers on Pen-maen-mawr, if we may judge from the extensive remains
of their industry recently discovered at Graig Llwyd.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The industry
of Le Grand-Pressigny seems, however, like the obsidian trade in the
Mediterranean, to belong to the closing phases of the neolithic age,
while the Graig Llwyd factory may well date from the bronze age.</p>

<p>So long as these products of local industry were distributed by land,
as in the case of Le Grand-Pressigny and Graig Llwyd, the old method of
barter from tribe to tribe was possible and doubtless still continued.
But when an island, such as Santorin, was the scene of production, such
methods were ineffectual, and a definite organisation for export became
necessary. To carry goods from one island to a neighbouring isle or to
the mainland requires a ship and a crew, besides some representatives
of the makers to effect the sales. When the ship has been equipped it
is economical to provide a full cargo, and this would be more than one
small community would need or could afford to purchase. This leads to
trading voyages of some days&rsquo; or weeks&rsquo; duration, when the ship can call
at a number of ports to meet the needs of many communities. The inland
inhabitants have also to be catered for, and the most serviceable ports
became in their turn fresh centres of distribution, and need a dep√¥t
under the supervision of a representative of the makers.</p>

<p>Thus, even before the close of the stone age, we see developing,
especially in the Mediterranean region, the beginnings of an
organised commerce, involving visits paid by ships and their crews
to distant ports and foreign communities, and sometimes leading to
the establishment of small foreign trading settlements. With the
introduction of metal these features increased rapidly, and, as we shall
see, before the bronze age had been in existence for many centuries, an
extensive trade had grown up, mainly by sea, but sometimes by land as
well, so that bronze became known and used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> over most parts of Europe
which were not too remote from the sea to be affected by sea-borne
commerce. Thus a considerable mingling of peoples and cultures took
place, not by the sudden arrival of large numbers of invading hordes,
but by the constant infiltration of small bodies of merchants and seamen.</p>

<p>The origin of the discovery of metal is still unknown, though many
ingenious suggestions have been made. All investigators are agreed that
gold, being the most strikingly conspicuous metal, was the first to be
noticed and used, though there are those who believe that copper was
almost if not quite as early a discovery. Professor Elliot Smith has
made interesting suggestions in both cases. He believes that somewhere
on the African shore of the Red Sea a cult arose which involved the use
of the cowry shell as an amulet for fertility; such cults are well-known
and widely spread.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> For some reason the shells did not ultimately
satisfy the people, or the supply diminished, and they made models in
gold, deposits of which were found in that locality. Thus the virtue of
the amulet, residing originally in its form, became transferred to the
material, and gold became and has since remained a lucky and fortunate
possession.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Copper, on the other hand, he believes to have been discovered in Egypt.
The inhabitants of this country had, in neolithic days, been in the
habit of mining malachite in the Sinaitic peninsula, and grinding this
mineral on slate palates into a powder, which they applied to their
eyes. Green powder thus applied is said to save the wearer from the
ill-effects of glaring sunlight, and perhaps served also to keep away
the flies, which are a constant source of ophthalmia. Professor Elliot
Smith suggests that an Egyptian grinding his lump of malachite on his
decorated slate palate, one day met with an unusually hard lump, which
he could not grind satisfactorily. In a fit of temper he threw the
offending morsel into the fire, doubtless with words of objurgation;
later on in the ashes he found a small red bead of copper. A repetition
of this action, no doubt with the same formula, produced an identical
result, and so the discovery of the reduction of copper from its ore was
made.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> I must admit that at one time I doubted the possibility of
this explanation, as I questioned whether the heat of a fire of dung,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
now and probably then also, the only available fuel, would be sufficient
to reduce the ore. To satisfy me on this point, Mr. R. H. Rastall of
Cambridge kindly made a laboratory experiment upon a piece of malachite,
and as a result assured me that the heat of a dung fire would be ample
for the purpose.</p>

<p>While admitting that Professor Elliot Smith&rsquo;s theories are both possible
and suggestive, I feel inclined to offer another, albeit more prosaic
solution to these problems. Primitive men, whether in prehistoric times
or among backward peoples to-day, and, dare I say it, this is perhaps
more true of primitive women, have a habit, not, I believe, quite
extinct even in more advanced circles, of collecting small objects with
natural perforations, or through which holes could readily be drilled,
and stringing them upon a thread or wire to make necklaces or bracelets
for the adornment of their persons. Such customs carry us back a long
way. The old Grimaldi woman from the <em>Grotte des enfants</em> wore two
bracelets composed of perforated shells, while her son, if indeed he
were her son, had worn on his head a chaplet of the same materials.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
The Alpine inhabitants of the North Italian lake-dwellings used the
vertebr√¶ of pike for the same purpose.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Whether the use of strings of
beads originated in some religious practice I know not, for it may be
that such religious associations, though found to-day among Buddhists,
Moslems and Christians, may be relatively modern. That in later days it
proved a safe and convenient way of storing accumulated wealth seems
more certain, and for this purpose the custom is still practised.
Perhaps after all the Preacher was right and this, like everything else,
was vanity.</p>

<p>Leaving the cause unsolved, we may be content to note that the practice
dates from the first arrival of modern man in Europe, and may be much
older. But shells and the vertebr√¶ of fish are easily damaged, and store
would have been set by perforated stones, which would have been much
more durable. Pebbles of clear quartz, with natural perforations, were
worn sometimes by our Saxon forefathers,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> but such stones are scarce
and would have been prized accordingly.</p>

<p>I picture to myself the first discoverer of gold as a young man wishing
to obtain the favour of a maid, or perhaps to purchase her from her
father. I imagine such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> youth going in search of some object, rare and
durable and capable of being strung on a necklace. Walking down to a
clear stream, perhaps to wash, though more probably to drink or to fish,
he noticed in its bed a brilliant yellow stone of quite exceptional
beauty. Picking it up and examining it he found he could bend it where
it was thin, so that with the aid of a stone he was able to fashion
it into the much sought-for bead. Here he had something which was
perforated, strong, rare and also beautiful. We can imagine that his
success would have been assured. Then would have followed the first gold
rush.</p>

<p>Now copper, too, is found in a native state, and is also malleable and
easily modelled with a stone hammer; it, too, is capable of exhibiting a
bright metallic lustre when clean. Though it could not compare with gold
for beauty, or in the permanence of its natural lustre, it could well
take second place, and being less rare it soon came to be used freely
for decorative purposes. At first it was obtained only in a native
state, and was hammered, not melted, as was the case until recent times
around Lake Superior.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Later some copper ornaments probably fell into
the fire, and it was thus discovered that it could be melted. Later
still experiments were made with other metallic-looking ores, such as
chalcopyrite, and the metal age had come.</p>

<p>Where these discoveries were made is still a matter of uncertainty.
Copper objects have been found not uncommonly in tombs of the second
predynastic period in Egypt, and sometimes in those of the first.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> So
rare, however, are they in the latter, that, since the two cultures must
to some extent have overlapped, it seems possible that the knowledge of
this metal was introduced into Egypt by the second pre-dynastic people.
It has been suggested recently that these people, with a copper culture,
bringing the knowledge of wheat and the cult of Osiris, came from North
Syria, from somewhere between Damascus and Beyrut,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and if Breasted&rsquo;s
views upon the Egyptian calender are sound, we may expect that they
entered the Delta 4241 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> or thereabouts.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>In Mesopotamia we are not very sure of our dates at so early a period,
nor have we got any clear evidence of the earliest copper civilisation
of that region, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> beautiful copper lions brought back from
Tell-el-&rsquo;Obeid, near Ur, by Dr. H. R. Hall<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>, show that at the time
when they were made the art of working copper must long have been known,
and Dr. Hall tells me that their date may be placed with fair certainty
between 3500 and 3000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> Small foundation figures, cast
solid in copper, have been found which date from the time of Ur-Nin√¢,
about 3000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>, while Mr. Raphael Pumpelly, describing
his excavations at Anau in Turkestan, states that he found copper
implements in a deposit, which on other grounds he dates between 8000
and 7000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> While there is no doubt that copper was found
in the lowest layer of the Anau village site, there are few people who
agree with the early date claimed for it by Mr. Pumpelly. Taking all
the available evidence into consideration, it seems likely that copper
was known and used in western Asia as early as 4500 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> and
might conceivably have been known as early as 5000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>; that
it was known before that seems unlikely as far as we can judge from the
evidence available at present.</p>

<p>Gold, as we have seen, seems to have been the first metal to be
discovered, though we have no sufficient reason for believing that its
discovery preceded that of copper by any considerable period. Objects
of gold have been found in graves of the second pre-dynastic period in
Egypt, as well as some of silver and of lead,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> so that before 3500
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span> the metal age had passed its infancy.</p>

<p>It will be seen from what has gone before, that the discovery of metal
must have taken place somewhere in western Asia; in Asia Minor, Armenia
or Persia. The knowledge spread first of all from tribe to tribe and
from city to city, and the objects were traded like the stone axes of
Le Grand-Pressigny and Graig Llwyd; but about 4241 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> this
knowledge was carried into Egypt with an invading people. So far, then,
there is no evidence of organised trade, for the gold, silver and lead,
which have been found in the pre-dynastic tombs, may have arrived in the
same way. Gold, it is true, was found in quartz veins in the granite
mountains by the shores of the Red Sea, and in the Wadi Foakhir,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
but it is not clear that these sources were tapped before the fourth or
fifth dynasties; in later days the principal source of supply was Nubia
which had, however, been inaccessible to traders until Mernere had made
the first cataract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> passable for navigation about 2570 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
Silver was always imported from abroad, probably from Cilicia.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>There are reasons for believing that some, at any rate, of the gold used
during the period of the Old Kingdom was of foreign origin. Professor
Flinders Petrie tells me that Dr. Gladstone made for him an analysis of
the gold object found in the tomb of King Khasakhemui, of the second
dynasty, who reigned, according to the chronology we are using, about
3200 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> He found on this gold object a red crust, which he
stated was antimoniate of gold. Now it appears that antimony will only
combine with gold in the presence of tellurium, and Professor Petrie
tells me that he has been advised that there is no known source of this
ore, telluride of gold and antimony, except in Transylvania. I have
been informed that all the gold found within the Carpathian ring is of
this nature, but as the richest sources lie in Transylvania, where gold
was worked by the Romans, the conclusion is the same, that before 3200
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span> the Egyptians were obtaining gold from Central Europe.</p>

<p>As it seems unlikely that gold would be carried between such distant
points as the valleys of the Danube and the Nile by the old method
of bartering from tribe to tribe, especially since there are so many
physical obstacles on the route, including the Taurus range, it seems
more likely that we should see here evidence for an organised sea
commerce. Not that I would imply a direct sea traffic from the Danube
to the Nile, but that some intermediate people, probably some islanders
in the √Ügean, the people perhaps of Melos or Crete, traded on the one
hand with settlements near the mouth of the Danube and with those in the
Delta as well. The obsidian trade of Melos may well be as early as this,
in fact it seems to have been on the decline by 3000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and
we find Cretan trade flourishing only a few centuries later. Either or
both of these islands might well have been responsible for this traffic.</p>

<p>Oversea trade, then, was in existence, if not very highly developed,
during the early days of metal, the centuries preceding 3000
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span> The knowledge of copper, and the possibility of making
copper nails and wire, must have given a great impetus to ship building,
which must at this stage have passed from the use of rafts and dug-outs
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> that of boats built as we know them now. But a new discovery,
greater even in some respects than those which I have been describing,
was still further to encourage oversea traffic.</p>

<p>The manufacture of implements of flint and obsidian had reached a high
pitch of perfection during the early days of metal, and although the
new materials were valuable for ornaments, copper knives were, in many
respects, less serviceable than stone ones, as the metal is soft and
its edge easily turned. It is true that many men, particularly those
who wished to display their wealth, preferred copper daggers to those
made of flint, for they were more ornate, more novel and had a scarcity
value. Those, however, who were poor, or untouched by the fashionable
snobbery, preferred the well-tried flint article, which was probably
more effective for its purpose.</p>

<p>But with the discovery that the addition of about ten per cent. of tin
to the copper produced an alloy of considerable hardness and no little
toughness as well, from which could be made implements which seldom
chipped or turned, and which could have their edges quickly renewed by
hammering or grinding did such an accident happen, the days of copper
came quickly to an end, and the traffic in flint implements, even in
obsidian, fell upon evil days. It was this discovery, which made metal
not merely a luxury, but a really serviceable article to man, which
brought the stone age to an end and ushered in the true metal age.</p>

<p>How, when and where this discovery was made is still a mystery. At one
time I was disposed to think that it was perhaps in Spain, where both
these metals are found, that the discovery was accidentally made, but
evidence which has come to hand quite recently has disposed of this
idea. Professor Sayce has recently published an extract from a tablet
found in the royal library of Assur.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> It is from a document drawn up
in the reign of Sargon of Akkad, whose date has now been finally fixed
at 2800 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> It is a geographical description of that monarch&rsquo;s
empire, giving a list of the provinces, at the close of which it is said
that his conquests had extended &ldquo;from the lands of the setting sun to
the lands of the rising sun, namely to the tinland (Ku-Ki) and Kaptara
(Crete) countries beyond the Upper Sea (the Mediterranean).&rdquo; At first
there was a tendency to interpret this passage as though Ku-Ki was
beyond the Mediterranean, and must refer either to Spain or Brittany;
but this is to misunderstand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> the passage. As Professor Sayce says: &ldquo;the
western extension of the empire ended with the Syrian coast; beyond
that were Kaptara or Krete and the Tinland.&rdquo; Ku-Ki may well have been
Cyprus, or some other island in the Mediterranean, or some region easily
accessible from it.</p>

<p>Now the importance of this passage is that it shows us that as early as
2800 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> the Babylonians were cognisant of the existence of
tin, and doubtless aware of its value as an ingredient of bronze; this
can only mean that they were using it to harden the copper, which they
had worked so well centuries earlier. The passage implies that Sargon&rsquo;s
rule extended to Ku-Ki, which may perhaps mean no more than that some
of his subjects had a trading post there. What seems important is that
the discovery of the value of tin and bronze had been made before 2800
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, somewhere in western Asia, though at what sites is at
present uncertain. Copper mines, which are known to have been worked at
an early date, exist south of Trebizonde, near Erzeroum, in Armenia and
at Diarbekir in the upper valley of the Tigris; ancient tin workings
have been found further east in Khorazan.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> But the local supply
of tin was apparently insufficient, and merchants from the Persian
Gulf were carrying on a trade in this commodity with a place in the
Mediterranean region, even if they had not already, as seems probable,
established a definite trading post in Ku-Ki.</p>

<p>Thus we see that a definite organised trade, both by sea and by land,
had been established in the eastern Mediterranean region before 2800
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and that this included a new and important feature, the
search for and importation of raw materials as well as the export of
manufactured articles.</p>

<p>Now, as I have shown elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> at a date which cannot be very
much later, during a period which closed about 2200 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, the
eastern Mediterranean was in close trade relations with Spain, and was
exploiting the mineral resources of that peninsula. At present it is
uncertain who these traders were, but they seem to have been in touch
with Crete, the Cyclades and the second city of Hissarlik, and perhaps
too with Cyprus. Though we have no evidence that these traders were from
the Persian Gulf, they were trading between Spain and the area in which
Ku-Ki probably lay, and if they were not subjects of the Babylonian
Empire, they were at least carrying on the metal trade first organised
by the people from the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Quite recently it has been stated that there is no clear evidence that
the Spanish copper mines had been worked at so early a time,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> but
the data cited by Siret<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> seem to me to prove conclusively that the
early settlements of El Argar had direct or indirect trade relations
with Hissarlik II., and the discovery throughout the Spanish peninsula
of clay balls of a certain type,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> which exactly resemble some found
by Schliemann in the burnt city,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> seems to me to place this early
connection beyond all reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>How early this Spanish trade began we cannot yet say with certainty,
beyond the fact that it must have been in existence for some time before
the destruction of Hissarlik II. in 2225 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> How long
it continued in the same hands is also uncertain. But, as I have shown
elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> there is evidence that while it lasted, and certainly
before 2000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, the eastern traders not only passed through
the Pillars of Hercules and discovered the tin fields in the north-west
of the peninsula, but learned also that both tin and gold were to be
found in the rivers of the south of Brittany. Before the close of the
third millennium, probably several centuries before its close, this
Levantine trade had reached the Morbihan, where stone axes have been
found which repeat the shapes of copper axes from Cyprus.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Now, if we compare the copper and bronze axes found throughout the
Mediterranean, from Cyprus to Spain, and those found along the west of
Europe from Spain to Brittany, we find a gradual change in form from
the triangular axes of Cyprus to the western type, with semi-circular
butt and widely splayed edge. The earliest types are found only in the
east, the more developed only in the west, for in the east they followed
a different line of development. It is true, however, in a general
way that the type develops as we pass westward and northward, two or
more varieties overlapping at many points en route. This can better be
understood by reference to the series of axes shown in Plate I., which
could probably be made more perfect, were it possible to get drawings of
all the specimens in local museums and private collections.</p>

<p>If again we take the copper daggers, with broad butts and slightly
ogival blades, several of which have been found in Crete, and compare
them again with those found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> at Scurgola in South Italy and Monteracello
in Sicily,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and with other types from Malta,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Spain, Brittany
and the west, we shall find the type gradually narrowing at the butt and
lengthening in the blade, till we come in later centuries to the type
commonly known as the rapier, but which I think might more correctly be
termed a dirk (see Plate II.).</p>

<p>The gradual evolution of the axe and the dagger as they pass westwards
and northwards seems to indicate a line of trade, spreading further and
further to the north-west as the centuries pass. At present we must be
content with an outline of the movement, but if illustrations of all the
specimens found in these regions were available, I doubt not but that
the evidence would be more convincing and the details and the dates more
minute and exact.</p>

<p>Thus we find these early traders seeking for copper, tin and gold, or
any other precious commodities, on the north-west of Europe before
2000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and it has been shown by various authorities that
among the gold-fields explored at that time none was richer than the
Irish gold-fields in the Wicklow Hills.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> It is needless here to
recapitulate all the evidence which has been adduced to establish
the early working of these deposits. The wealth of gold ornaments of
this period found in the island, most of which have passed into the
melting pot, but hundreds of which are still in the National Museum at
Dublin,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> would alone be sufficient evidence; but we know also that
certain ornaments, known as <em>lunul√¶</em> or crescents, were exported and
reached Brittany, Denmark and Germany.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> It is likely, too, that
gold objects of Irish origin reached to more distant places.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> This
shows us that Ireland was in touch with the trade routes we have been
discussing, and this in turn accounts for the vast numbers of bronze
implements of early types which are to be found in all museums and
private collections, not only in Ireland itself, but throughout Great
Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>It would seem probable that the early traders from the Mediterranean
also reached the Baltic at about the same date, for we find there, too,
an early bronze industry, which, while bearing a close resemblance
to Central European models, exhibits also western and Mediterranean
types.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The search for amber probably induced our traders to go
to this distant region, for amber, like the precious metals, was much
in request in Mediterranean lands, for again it was a substance from
which beads could readily be made. It was probably these traders who
carried with them the news of the Irish gold-fields, and in due course
other traders, starting out from the Baltic, joined the gold rush. We
have already seen that a gold crescent of Irish work has been found in
Denmark, we can find, too, other evidence of this trade.</p>

<p>Now if we plot out on a map of the British Isles the sites at which
have been found the bronze implements of this period, and such a map of
flat celts was published some years ago by Mr. O. G. S. Crawford,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
we shall notice certain striking features. Where the chalk lands or
limestone hills exist these finds are fairly numerous and generally
distributed, for, as Crawford showed, these areas were open grass lands.
But throughout the rest of the country these sites string out into long
lines, and these lines, if produced, would intersect near Dublin; these
lines seem to indicate trade routes, passing through thickly wooded and
probably uninhabited country on their way to the Irish gold-fields.</p>

<p>One such route starts from Southampton and passing Winchester, crosses
the Kennet at Newbury, where it was met perhaps by a route from
Chichester. Thence it passed by the head waters of the Thames to a point
on the Cotswolds not far from Cirencester, where it may have been joined
by other routes from the south-west. It descended the scarp slope of
the Cotswold at or near Broadway, crossed the Avon near Evesham, and
the Severn at Bevere Island above Worcester. Thence it passed up the
west side of the valley, crossing the river again below Shrewsbury.
Its course across north Shropshire seems to have lain on the watershed
between the Tern and the Perry, if we may judge from evidence of a later
date,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> thence passing from Ebnal towards Llanarmon-dyffryn-Ceiriog,
it crossed over to the Dee Valley, where we can pick up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> fresh evidence
near Corwen. From the head of Bala lake it seems to have turned slightly
north of west, instead of passing down the Mawddach Valley, and it
reached the coast somewhere to the north of Harlech, perhaps by the
so-called Roman steps at Cwm Bychan. This is the best attested route so
far traced out, but further work is required to establish its course
with precision all the way.</p>

<p>Another route from the Yorkshire coast through York to the Aire gap
has been described by Colonel E. Kitson Clark,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> while some years
ago I traced several from the borders of the Fens into Leicestershire,
where they met at Bardon Hill; thence the route passed through
Ashby-de-la-Zouch as far as Burton-on-Trent, where it seemed to be
pointing to the Peak district.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> There appears to be a route running
thence by Macclesfield and Knutsford towards Warrington, while there are
signs that the route through the Aire gap also turned south towards the
same spot. Near Warrington a number of flat axes have been found,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
some on the north and some to the south. The northern settlement was
in the parish of Winwick, and among the things found there and dating
from this time is a battle-axe of the so-called boat-axe or <em>batyx</em>
type.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> This type and the flint of which it is made both indicate
Denmark as the place of origin. The fact that both these trade routes
run to Warrington, which seems then to have been an island in the middle
of the Mersey, shows, I think, that here we have a port, from which
in the early bronze age Baltic traders set sail for Dublin Bay.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
Warrington, therefore, rather than Chester, was the first predecessor of
Liverpool, and the Mersey holds its own as the earliest estuary used for
the western trade. Crawford&rsquo;s map also shows that a similar trade route
must have crossed Scotland from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde
and the Mull of Galloway, but no details of such route have been worked
out.</p>

<p>Much work yet remains to be done before the courses of these trade
routes can be traced with precision and their dates fully established,
but enough has been said, I trust, to show that in addition to direct
sea routes from Brittany, the Irish gold fields tempted traders to cross
both England and Scotland on their way from France and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> the Baltic.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
These traders would have needed provisions for the journey, and for
these would have bartered bronze axes to the people settled on the chalk
downs and limestone hills. The journey across the Midland plain was
through a densely wooded and probably uninhabited area, and in passing
through Wales they kept mostly to the valleys, while the bulk of the
population grazed its sheep on the high moorlands.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The few axes
found must have been such as were lost by the way, and considering the
number found this indicates an extensive traffic.</p>

<p>In Ireland the traders probably employed the natives to wash the
alluvial gold; they had also to barter with them for their supplies.
No wonder, then, that bronze implements of the earliest type have been
found almost more abundantly in that island than in any other part of
Europe, while the number of gold objects found there is unsurpassed
elsewhere. Doubtless the natives worked the gold fields sometimes on
their own account, and they seem also to have tried to supply themselves
with home-made metal axes. There are veins of copper ore in various
parts of the island, which they seem to have discovered, but tin is to
all intents and purposes absent.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> It is possible, too, that the
traders refused to divulge the secret of the tin alloy. It would have
been strange indeed had they not done so, and so the native Irish, for
a time at least, made themselves axes of copper. This, at least, seems
so be the most plausible explanation of the great number of copper axes
found in that island.</p>

<p>The foregoing is, of necessity, but a brief account of the early metal
trade and its relations with Celtic lands. To do the subject justice
would require more space than is at my disposal; nor is the time yet
ripe for more detailed treatment. This outline will serve to show that
foreign elements reached Celtic lands some 4000 years ago, though in
small numbers; who these people were must be considered in the next
chapter.</p>

C<span class="smaller">HAPTER</span> IV<br />

<span class="s5">THE PROSPECTORS</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smaller">N</span> many parts of the
world there are to be found monuments of rough,
unhewn stones, sometimes rudely shaped by hammering, which from the
size of the stones used have been termed megalithic monuments.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
These consist of burial chambers, either a simple slab or capstone
supported on four or more uprights, or a similar but more complex
chamber, approached by a stone-lined passage. Other monuments consist
of circles or alignments of standing stones, or single stones only set
in an upright position. There are many types; some, like the dolmen
or simplest burial chamber, or the simple standing stone, are widely
distributed, while others have a restricted range. One type of elaborate
temple is found only in Malta and in the adjacent island of Gozo.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
Such monuments have these features in common: the stones are large, they
have not been hewn with chisels or axes, and they are orthostatic or set
on end.</p>

<p>Frequently associated with these megalithic monuments are other
structures, which are believed to belong to the same culture, though
the association is not so clearly established. Such are bee-hive huts,
round towers, and dry walls with polygonal masonry. These are often
found in close association with the erections of larger stones, but not
infrequently where true megalithic structures are absent.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>An attempt has been made to show that the dolmen originated in Egypt,
and is closely connected with the <em>mastaba</em>, the tomb used throughout
the earliest dynasties.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Elsewhere I have endeavoured to show that
there are reasons why we cannot attribute the origin of these structures
to the inhabitants of the Nile Valley, and that the resemblances
may better be explained by supposing that the idea of the former
was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> introduced into Egypt, perhaps at the beginning of the second
predynastic period, from some region, such as Syria, where dolmens were
known, or else that both had been derived from a common ancestry.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>It has been suggested by some inquirers that the fashion of erecting
such megalithic monuments of orthostatic blocks arose at one time
and in one place, and was carried by degrees from centre to centre
until it reached many widely scattered regions between Ireland and
Polynesia.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> It is not suggested that this culture, with which has
been associated many others, such as terrace cultivation, irrigation,
the use of conch shells and a number of others, was carried to all
these places simultaneously or even within the same millennium, nor is
it asserted that the people who introduced it to these widely scattered
regions were of necessity the same. The idea may, I think, be better
expressed by saying that a cult or religion became widely disseminated
at an early date, that it developed many varieties in the regions in
which it took root, and that these regions often became in time fresh
centres for dissemination. Thus it might happen that a daughter cult
might ultimately become spread through part of the region in which the
parent cult had arisen. A parallel may be drawn from the spread of
Christianity, especially in these islands. The new faith reached Britain
during the period of the Roman occupation and thence spread to Ireland;
later, when it had disappeared from the former, it passed from Ireland
to Iona and thence back to England.</p>

<p>We need not discuss the whole of this hypothesis, which is concerned
with a much wider area than the lands we are considering. One of the
most essential features, however, of this interesting thesis is that the
people, whoever they were, who spread the cult of megalithic monuments
and allied practices, were travelling in search of gold, silver, copper,
tin, amber and pearls; they were, in fact, merchants in search of
precious and easily portable commodities.</p>

<p>Now Perry,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> who has specially worked at this part of the hypothesis,
maintains that megalithic monuments are invariably found in association
with metalliferous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> deposits, amber coasts and pearl fisheries, and
he has produced maps which appear at first sight very convincing. A
careful examination of his megalith map shows that he has copied that
of Fergusson, published in 1872,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and which represents far less
accurately the distribution of these monuments than does that published
by Colonel A. Lane-Fox in 1869.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Neither of these maps, however,
gives us a really reliable summary of the facts. Much work has been
done on this subject since these maps were produced, many fresh areas
have been added, and two at least have been deducted; but no one has
recently attempted to make a map of the European megaliths, or those of
any country except Holland.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The French anthropologists have made a
list of the dolmens in France, and published a summary giving the number
noted in each department,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> a catalogue of the British megaliths is
in process of formation.</p>

<p>Wherever it has been possible to test it with sufficient accuracy, we
find that Perry&rsquo;s contention is substantially true, and that there is a
definite relation between many areas rich in megalithic structures and
deposits of metal which are known to have been worked in early days;
the megalithic areas of the Baltic coincide fairly well with the coasts
producing amber. Nevertheless there are many spots, rich in metals, and
which are known or suspected to have been worked in early days, where
megaliths, have not hitherto been noted, and on the other hand, dolmens
and other such structures occur, sometimes with great frequency, in
areas devoid of metals or other precious commodities. The problem is not
quite so simple as it would appear from Perry&rsquo;s account.</p>

<p>Still, looking at the matter broadly in the light of information
available at present, it does seem that, in western Europe at any
rate, the megalithic monuments cluster thickest in or <em>around</em> those
regions which produced gold, copper, tin and amber, and which were
readily accessible to maritime traffic, and that they coincide very
closely with the lines of trade which I described in the last chapter.
The exceptions, too, are not destructive to the hypothesis. In the
British Isles we find that the megaliths in the main coincide with
the metalliferous areas, though in some cases more closely with lead
ores than with the metals previously mentioned. As lead does not seem
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> have been used in north-west Europe before 1000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>,
these monuments must, if any connection be implied, date from a much
later period than that which we are discussing. But a large number of
megalithic structures are found in the region surrounding Salisbury
Plain and in certain parts of the Cotswolds. These are some of those
open chalk and limestone areas already mentioned, which were the
early centres of population in this country. As we have seen, certain
trade routes to Ireland seem to traverse these regions, and here the
merchants would have obtained their supplies of food for the rest of
their journey; it would not surprise us, therefore, if they introduced
their cult here, and that these populous areas formed fresh centres of
dispersion.</p>

<p>The long barrows of Wiltshire and the Cotswold areas, and the same
is probably true of those in South Wales, have been thought by some
Scandinavian arch√¶ologists to be closely related to the types peculiar
to the Baltic region. Dr. Knut Sterjna<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> believed that the English
chambered long barrows represented a stage in the evolution from the
dolmens to the chambered barrows (<em>s√©pultures √† galerie</em>) of Denmark and
Sweden. The stone circles, which are conspicuous in the Salisbury plain
area, are absent in France, and seem to have originated by the Baltic.
It would seem, then, that some at any rate of our English megaliths were
introduced, not so much by merchants coming from the south as by those
adventurers who came later from the Baltic region, some of whom we have
seen passed across this country to the port at Warrington.</p>

<p>In France, too, though megaliths are more numerous and finer in the
Morbihan, where we have seen that tin and gold were found, than
elsewhere in that country, yet they cluster thickly in Finist√®re, and
in a curved line from that department to the Mediterranean coast near
Narbonne.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> The occurrence of so many megaliths in Finist√®re and
the adjoining departments may be due to the need of the early traders
to take refuge in the inlets of that region, while endeavouring to
round the dangerous promontory. That they did so not infrequently
is shown by the occurrence near these inlets of numerous hoards of
bronze implements, most of which date from the time which we are
discussing.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>The band across the country clusters most thickly just north-east of
the line, running through the Carcassone gap, now followed by the
<em>canal du midi</em>. This seems to indicate that a land route through the
pass was in use at this time, as a safer alternative to rounding the
Iberian peninsula by sea. From this line the cult seems to have spread
north-eastwards, though these monuments grow scarcer the further we
leave this line.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are certain islands in which these monuments are found,
which do not seem to have produced any wealth of the type required,
notably Sardinia and Malta. We have also an isolated group near
Taranto. It seems probable that such islands, and points <em>en route</em>
with good harbours like Taranto, would have been convenient points of
call to these traders, as Tarentum was afterwards to the Ph&#339;nician
and Greek merchants. Here, and perhaps too at Syracuse, they may well
have had dep√¥ts, but from the wealth of its megalithic monuments we
may well believe that Malta was the base of operations for the western
and northern trade. Here we have a small island, very isolated and
with excellent ports, with a population primitive and docile; such
a spot would be a safe dep√¥t in which to collect and store valuable
merchandise, until it was convenient to ship it through the more
traversed and perhaps pirate-infested seas of the east. Thus, though
there are more exceptions to his rule than Perry would lead us to
suspect, these exceptions do not seem to weaken his hypothesis, but
rather help to prove the rule.</p>

<p>Now in Britain and the north generally these monuments, or at any rate
some of them such as dolmens and long barrows, are believed to date from
the neolithic age, albeit from its latest phases; nevertheless there
are instances in Scandinavia and Brittany of the discovery of copper
tools and gold beads in these tombs.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Further south the evidence
of metal in association with them is clearer, but in Malta the only
bronze implements discovered, the hoard found in 1915 in the temple of
Hal Tarxien,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> had been deposited above three feet of silt which had
accumulated on the temple floor. This at first sight seems to militate
against the theory that these structures were the tombs and temples of
miners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not think, however, that these facts are necessarily fatal to
the hypothesis. In the first instance it is probable that gold and
amber were the objects of search, and these were probably to a large
extent exported. For a long time metal implements must have been rare
in these regions, and the people might well have hesitated to bury
them with their dead. The tools of metal were modern and new-fangled,
while burial customs are singularly conservative, as we can see at any
English funeral. For centuries and millennia it had been customary to
bury with the corpse weapons of stone for use in the next world; what
kind of a reception would the deceased have had on his arrival with a
metal instrument? It would have been a great risk, which was seldom
if ever taken. In matters of burial and religion, which are in fact
one, the older course is safer, and so these people, even after metal
was known, continued to bury stone implements with their dead, just as
Joshua circumcised the Israelites with flint knives.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The temples
of Malta, too, were erected without the use of metal tools, as was
Solomon&rsquo;s temple,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and it is probable that while this cult lasted
no metal object might be taken within the shrine. It was only after Hal
Tarxien had been deserted, and its floor covered with three feet or more
of dust, that traders in bronze, or perhaps pirates, who knew not the
ancient cult, ventured to bury their treasure in the desolated sanctuary.</p>

<p>In a recent paper Mr. Thurlow Leeds has suggested that the dolmen
originated in the Iberian peninsula, in the basin of the Tagus, and
thence spread throughout west Europe.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The first type he believes
to have been polygonal with a short gallery of approach, lined with
large stones, and this gallery seems, from his plans, to have been
somewhat in the nature of an antechamber. He further shows that such
primitive dolmens are derived from cave tombs, found in the neighbouring
region, and in these caves the antechamber seems more apparent. More
recently<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> he has compared these early dolmens with certain rock-cut
tombs at Castellucio near Syracuse, though, if I understand him aright,
he would derive the Sicilian tombs from those in Portugal. Taking all
the facts into consideration it seems more likely that the Iberian caves
and dolmens are derived from the rock-cut tombs of south-east Sicily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the date of this trade we can say little with certainty at
present. We have seen that objects have been found in Spain which
seem to point to a connection with Hissarlik II. In the temple of Hal
Tarxien in Malta were found certain carved stones with a double spiral
ornament<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>, which exactly resemble some in the Syracuse museum, which
had closed some of the rock-cut tombs near that city.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> These tombs
have been relegated by Signor Orsi to the period he calls Siculan I.,
and to this period belong the rock-cut tombs at Castellucio, in one of
which was found several pieces of carved ivory, which closely resemble
a piece found in Hissarlik II<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>. This city was founded about 2500
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, or perhaps some centuries earlier, and seems to have
been sacked about 2225 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The trade then which we are
discussing must have taken place during the latter half of the third
millennium <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and in the light of the Babylonian tablet
already quoted may well have begun some centuries earlier. How soon the
trade and the megalith cult passed on from Spain to Brittany and thence
to Ireland and the Baltic is uncertain, though it becomes difficult to
fit in all the successive cultures unless we postulate that megalithic
monuments were known in Denmark and the south of Sweden as early as 2400
or 2500 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>; in Brittany a still earlier date seems to be
needed. We may then suggest tentatively that the Atlantic trade began
before the close of the first half of the third millennium.</p>

<p>All this seems to indicate that the rock-cut tomb with an antechamber,
the fore-runner of the dolmen, came from Asia; the antechamber also
occurs in the Egyptian <em>mastaba</em>. Professor Elliot Smith believes that
this structure, and the use of the antechamber, developed in Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
but of this I do not feel confident. It may well have been introduced
into that land from the north-east by his Giza folk. If these may be
identified, as I think they may, with Newberry&rsquo;s people, who introduced
wheat and the second pre-dynastic culture, we must postulate the use of
rock-cut tombs with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> antechambers in Syria before 4000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>
Rock-cut tombs and dolmens, dating from before and just after the
discovery of metal, are not uncommon in some parts of this region.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Some years ago Professor Fleure was engaged in a detailed survey of the
physical characters of the present inhabitants of Wales, and the results
of this inquiry were published in 1916.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Among the many types noted
was one which is of special interest in this connection. He describes it
as: &ldquo;powerfully built, often intensely dark, broad-headed, broad-faced,
strong and square jawed men characteristic of the Ardudwy coast, the
south Glamorgan coast, the Newquay district (Cardiganshire), Pencaer
in north Pembrokeshire, and other places.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> He states in another
place; &ldquo;We found our dark, stalwart, broad-headed men on certain coastal
patches, often curiously associated with megaliths in Wales.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
Later on he states that a similar type has been noted in Ireland,
about Wicklow, in South Devon, and perhaps Cornwall, in the gulf of
Saint Brieuc, around Narbonne, in the Asturias and around Oviedo, on
the Andalusian coast from Motril to Moguer, in the gulf of Salerno and
thence past the gulf of Taranto to Bari, on the Adriatic.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>It will thus be seen that this type appears to occur in just those
regions in which megaliths and traces of early mining have been found.
The inference Fleure has drawn is that in some way these people were
connected with the ancient trade we have been discussing.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Though
I cannot find that he has published the fact, Fleure has told me that
he has noted the type in many of our commercial centres, especially in
sea-port towns. It is not uncommon in Liverpool, especially in shipping
circles.</p>

<p>Some years previous to the publication of Fleure&rsquo;s paper I had noted in
Athens, in the restaurant at which I usually lunched, a type which I was
unable to place among those described by Ripley. I noted, too, that they
looked prosperous and were evidently well-off. Early in 1914 I noted
the same type in Alexandria, especially common among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> the successful
Greek cotton merchants. Both these occurrences puzzled me until in 1916
Fleure&rsquo;s paper seemed to offer an explanation. I then remembered having
noted the same type in Venice and Florence, and among the portraits in
both those cities of successful merchants of the renaissance; it also
occurred to me that the type could often be seen in London, especially
in the city.</p>

<p>When it became clear that here was a type, not recognised or described
by any previous anthropologist, and one, moreover, with a rather unusual
distribution, it was felt that it should receive a name, which should
identify it neither with any people past or present, nor with any
language, for such equations would inevitably lead to confusion, nor
with any place or country, for its place of origin was uncertain. Since
the distribution of the type seemed to be in maritime trading centres,
or else in those areas which were connected with ancient mining or
trade, it was felt that this type must have been associated with these
enterprises. Taking therefore a name, commonly used in America and in
our colonies for those who go out to search for gold or other precious
metals, we decided to term them &ldquo;Prospectors,&rdquo; and by this name they
will now be called.</p>

<p>Constant observations since made on people of this type have shown us
that they are remarkably clever, especially at money making, and that
they engage more in trade than in manufacture, and that their trade is
commonly in oversea commodities, when it is not in money itself. The
type seems intermediate between that of the Mediterranean and of the
Alpine, and suggests a cross, but the great stature which is sometimes,
though not invariably, found among them suggested that the cross was
probably between the Mediterranean and the eastern Alpine or Anatolian
type, rather than with the short and stumpy western Alpine. It was
felt that they had reached the west and north from somewhere in the
eastern Mediterranean region,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> as had in all probability the cult
of megalithic monuments, and certainly the knowledge of metals. Further
than this it was not possible to trace them.</p>

<p>Now, as has already been noted, the Prospector type has been noticed
not uncommonly in Florence, both among the present population and in
the fifteenth century portraits. A glance at some of the pictures on
the Etruscan tombs,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> portrait statuettes on the alabaster
sarcophagi, shows us a type corresponding very closely to Fleure&rsquo;s
description.</p>

<p>The Etruscans are a mysterious people, and various views which have been
expressed as to their origin have led to no little confusion of thought.
Leaving out of account such evidence as may have come down from the
neolithic and early bronze ages, we find, according to tradition, that
the Etruscans arrived from Asia Minor, probably in the eleventh century
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, or perhaps a little later.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> About 800 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>
we have arch√¶ological evidence of the arrival of another people from the
north, who settled near Bologna, where they developed a culture known as
that of Villa-Nova. The Etruscans and the Villa-Nova people certainly
exchanged products, and may have to some extent amalgamated. Later
traditions suggest that the Etruscans extended their empire over the
Villa-Nova area and to the south as well,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> but this, while true in
one sense, may give a very wrong impression.</p>

<p>I would suggest that the Etruscans proper, the <em>Etruscus obesus</em> of the
Latin writers, were the people who so closely resemble our Prospectors,
and the fact that they are said to have come from the east, agrees well
with this view. The Prospectors, wherever we meet them, are merchants
and business men, and not the kind of men to lead warlike expeditions,
or to bring all Italy within their empire. On the other hand, as I hope
to show in subsequent chapters, the men responsible for the Villa-Nova
culture were a warlike, conquering type, given to imperial expansion,
and it is far more likely that if one or other were the conqueror it
would be the men of Villa-Nova.</p>

<p>That such was the case seems to be indicated by the frescoes in a
tomb, a copy of which is on view in the garden of the Etruscan museum
at Florence. In these we find depicted a country house, with domestic
scenes, and a portrait of the owner, a fair man with a narrow face,
blue eyes and brown beard, wearing a fox-skin head-dress. This man
is totally unlike the <em>Etruscus obesus</em> of most of the other tomb
paintings, and seems to be of that fair Nordic type, which, as I hope to
show, formed the ruling caste, at any rate, of the Villa-Nova people.
It seems probable, too, that the bodies buried in the Regulini-Galassi
and other warrior tombs were also of this type.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> All this seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
to suggest that the Villa-Nova people at one time conquered Etruria,
then extended their empire as far south as Naples and Pompeii. The
Etruscan prospectors would not have been averse to this extension of the
dominions of their war-lords, as their trade was doubtless increased
thereby.</p>

<p>But it may be argued that megalithic monuments are not to be found in
Tuscany, though it was once said that this was the case.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> This, of
course, is true, but the Etruscans are believed not to have entered
Italy until after 1100 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, when such erections were in most
places obsolete. Some of the earliest of the Etruscan tombs, however,
look as though they had developed from the dolmen form,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> though they
are made of well-wrought stone, rock-cut tombs are of common occurrence,
and dry polygonal walling, which, as we have seen, often occurs in
megalithic areas, is not uncommon,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and there is a very fine example
of this work at Fiesole.</p>

<p>Morris Jastrow junior,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> in studying the religion of Babylonia, was
struck with certain resemblances between the religious practices of that
country and those in vogue in Etruria. Here I will only mention three
points: the Sumerians, like the Etruscans, lived in city states; the
Sumerians were governed by priestly magistrates known as Patesi, while
the Etruscans had similar officials called Lucumons; lastly both peoples
were addicted to the practice of hepatoscopy, or the art of divining
by means of sheeps&rsquo; livers, and made models of the livers to aid their
students. Such models have been found in Sumer and Etruria, and nowhere
else except at Boghaz Keui, on the Halys, the ancient capital of the
Hittites.</p>

<p>Relatively few sculptured figures of the Sumerians have come down to
us, but those which have been found show us a sturdy people, not very
tall, short in the neck and with broad heads,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and some of the
Etruscan tomb paintings resemble fairly closely some of the Sumerian
reliefs.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Besides this some of the small statuettes brought by M. de
Morgan from Susa,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> show us heads which bear a close resemblance to
those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> found on the Etruscan alabaster sarcophagi. It is a far cry from
Etruria to Sumer, but tradition brings the Etruscans from Asia Minor,
and Boghaz Keui may have been an intermediate station, though probably
not the only one. But we have seen that the Babylonians were engaged in
trading for tin in the Mediterranean region in 2800 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, so
that it is not altogether impossible that the Prospectors may have come
in the first instance from the Persian gulf, where they had been known
as Sumerians, though it is, of course, possible that the Prospector was
not the only element of that population.</p>

<p>A very natural reply to such a suggestion is that megalithic monuments
do not occur in Sumer, or, as I should prefer to state it, have not yet
been observed near the Persian gulf. Such absence is not, however, fatal
to our hypothesis. As we have seen it seems likely that the dolmen is
derived from the rock-cut tomb, and such tombs, and dolmens too, occur
in Syria. As yet we know little about the tombs of Mesopotamia before
3000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and still less of their contents; we may yet find in
that region some sepulchre, perhaps built of sun-dried brick, perhaps of
slabs of stone, which bears a closer resemblance to the dolmen than does
the Egyptian <em>mastaba</em>.</p>

<p>The contention is that several lines of evidence point to the Sumerians,
or certain groups of them, as being the traders who travelled the
Mediterranean and the Atlantic coast of Europe in search of precious
metals, and who are somehow responsible for the spread of the megalithic
culture. Now, as we have seen, the Prospector is normally a merchant,
we do not find him as a rule among miners and sailors, yet sailors must
have accompanied these expeditions, and perhaps skilled miners also in
some cases. It may be that the cult of the dolmen, or the rock-cut tomb
which preceded it, belonged to one or other of these humbler peoples,
perhaps recruited from the coast of Syria. Or it may be, again, that the
Prospector, being unable to bury his dead after the fashion customary
by the Persian Gulf, devised another plan more convenient for use in
strange lands. The latter is, I am inclined to think, the more likely
solution, since dolmens and other megalithic structures are found all
round Sumer, in Syria and Palestine to the west<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>, in the Crimea and
the Caucasus.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Stone circles are found to the east in Seistan<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>,
while both these and dolmens occur further east in India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>Time will show whether the suggestion, which I have put forward, that
the Prospectors, who seem to have been responsible for introducing the
use of metal into the west and north, to which they came in search of
precious ores, started originally from the Persian Gulf, or whether,
indeed they were but sojourners in southern Mesopotamia, having arrived
there by sea from some more distant land, bringing with them the seeds
of civilisation, as the legends of Oannes, the exalted fish-man, as
given by Berosus, seem to indicate.<a name="FNanchor_173_173"
id="FNanchor_173_173"> </a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>Be this as it may, there seems to be adequate evidence of a trade,
starting in the eastern Mediterranean and going first to Malta and
Sicily, and thence to Spain, Brittany, the British Isles and the
Baltic. That the prime object of such trade was the procuring of
gold, copper, tin and amber, seems equally certain, as does the fact
that megalithic monuments are found associated with all the sites
whence these commodities could be obtained, as well as upon the land
routes connecting them. Further, a certain type of man, whom we term
the Prospector, is found living in no small numbers in most of these
megalithic areas, as well as becoming a successful merchant at many
of the sea-port towns of Europe. Lastly we have seen that this trade,
then in the hands of Babylonians, had reached the Mediterranean by 2800
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, was in touch with Malta, Sicily and Spain between 2600
and 2300 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and scarcely later had reached Brittany, Ireland
and the Baltic.</p>

<p>Thus it seems clear that the Prospectors, in search of metal, reached
Celtic lands, where their descendants may yet be found. What language
they spoke is uncertain; it may have been allied to Etruscan or to
Sumerian. But judging from their cosmopolitan habits, one may surmise
that they were polyglot, and adopted the language of the country in
which they settled. We can, then, hardly expect to detect any survivals
of the Prospector tongue in the modern Celtic languages, unless
indeed it be some loan words connected with the metal trade.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smaller">E</span> have seen that there is good reason for suspecting that it was from
the mountain zone of Central Europe, which we have decided to call the
Celtic Cradle, that the Celtic tongues spread over the west, and now
that we have traced the movements of foreign influences into Celtic
lands during the earlier phases of the bronze age, we must inquire what
was happening meanwhile in this Alpine cradle.</p>

<p>It was about 6000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> that the Ofnet race had arrived in this
region, where they had mingled with some remnants of the Combe Capelle
race, thus producing, it is thought, the Alpine type, which we find
dominant in the mountains to-day. We have found reason for believing
that further waves of Alpines, coming it is believed from the Armenian
highlands, had arrived by 4000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and that these had brought
with them domesticated animals, the germs of agriculture, and a few
fruits, such as the apple, plum and cherry.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>These people settled down in the mountain valleys, by the margins of
the lakes, or more often at their heads, where broad expanses of marsh
produced luxurious crops of grass; this could be converted into hay,
with which to feed their cattle during the long, snow-bound winters. On
the harder slopes above they tilled their patches of grain and planted
their orchards, while for security from the bears and wolves which
infested the forest-clad mountains, they built their dwellings upon
piles in the marshes, or in the shallow waters of the lakes. Thus they,
and their cattle, which were stalled in the same dwellings,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> could
be safe from the attacks of wild beasts, or the more adventurous and
less scrupulous of their neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Remains of such pile-dwellings have been found throughout all the
mountain zone, from Geneva and Neuch√¢tel in Switzerland, and Annecy
and Bourget in Savoy,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> to Laibach in Carniola on the edge of the
Hungarian plain.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> We learn, too, from classical writers that similar
pile dwellings existed in P√¶onia,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> probably in Lake Beshika north
of Salonika, as well as in Asia Minor.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> This is additional proof,
if that were needed, of the route by which these people had arrived in
Europe.</p>

<p>Several anthropologists have made a study of the mental characters of
these Alpine people, and, although these studies have been made for the
most part in France, the description holds good for the inhabitants of
the Alpine region. These have thus been summed up by Ripley:<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;A certain passivity, or patience, is characteristic of the Alpine
peasantry. This is true all the way from north-western Spain, where
Tubino notes its degeneration into morosity in the peasantry, as far
as Russia, where the great inert Slavic horde of north-eastern Europe
submits with abject resignation to the political despotism of the house
of the Romanoffs.... As a rule ... the Alpine type makes a comfortable
and contented neighbour, a resigned and peaceful subject.... The most
persistent attribute to the Alpine Celt is his extreme attachment to the
soil, or, perhaps, better, to locality. He seems to be a sedentary type
<em>par excellence</em>; he seldom migrates, except after great provocation; so
that, once settled, he clings to his patrimony through all persecution,
climatic or human. If he migrates to the cities, ... he generally
returns home to the country to spend his last days in peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ripley says that they are socially conservative, and this is true in the
sense that they dislike change; but an examination of the constitution
of their villages leads one to believe that they are very democratic
and, in fact, inclined to communism, though this tendency is usually
confined to village affairs, and rarely penetrates national politics. It
must be remembered, however, that Soviet Russia is mainly Alpine, and
that Marx came from the Alpine zone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus we find that these people were patient, plodding, and
hard-working,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> while the long, snow-bound winters had encouraged
habits of thrift, for it was necessary to provide during the summer a
sufficient store of food to last through the cold weather. They were not
hunters, and in no sense sportsmen, and seem to have been lacking in the
spirit of adventure. They feared the waste and its wild inhabitants,
and lived in their self-contained villages, with the drawbridge up, and
had little contact with their neighbours. As we have seen, they were
extremely democratic in their outlook, probably with a strong tendency
to communism, and they shared everything in common, perhaps even their
wives.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>During the early days of these lake-dwellings, in what is known as
the Archaic period, there seems to have been little to disturb their
peace,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> for the remnants of Combe Capelle man seem to have become
extinct or to have merged with the rest of the population. But towards
the close of the second period, that called the Robenhausen, about
3000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, or perhaps rather later, there is evidence of the
appearance of intruders into this region.</p>

<p>The newcomers were few in number, and seem to have arrived from the
north up the Rhine valley. From the skeletons found in the tombs of
this period we find that they were tall, long-headed men, with strongly
marked eye-brow ridges, and bear a close resemblance to those tall,
fair-headed, grey-eyed men, who are still dominant in the north of
Europe, and who are known to anthropologists as the Nordic race.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>Such were the people of the mountain zone during neolithic times, and it
is possible that the inhabitants of Hungary were similar in type, though
the long-headed race seems to have appeared here earlier. It is true
that we have few remains from the Hungarian plain which we can attribute
with certainty to this period, but the broad skull found at Nagy-sap
belongs, in all probability, to this time, though a greater age has been
claimed for it.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Perhaps the few facts available would be better
explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> by supposing that the Alpines occupied the whole mountain
zone, and the mountainous regions surrounding the Hungarian plain, and
that about 3000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> Nordic intruders entered Switzerland from
the Rhine Basin, and the plain of Hungary, perhaps, through the Moravian
gate.</p>

<p>As we pass eastwards from the Carpathians the rainfall becomes less and
the woodland disappears; we enter the steppe lands which reach far into
Asia. This steppe occupies the whole of the Rumanian plain, and north of
the Dniester runs in a belt, fifty miles wide, as far west as Lemberg.
West of this lie large stretches of glacial sands and gravels, which
must have carried an open heath vegetation, and so almost continuous
open land stretched at the northern foot of the Carpathians from Odessa
by Lemberg and Cracow to Breslau.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>In this open region, bounded on the east by the Dnieper and on the north
by the Polish forest, we find at the time which we are discussing a very
peculiar culture; this has been called the Tripolje culture,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> from
the site near Kief where it was first discovered. The people responsible
for this culture lived in pit-dwellings, and set aside certain &ldquo;areas&rdquo;
for the disposal of their dead. Usually, if not invariably, they burnt
their dead and placed the ashes in urns, which they deposited in these
areas, but it has been said that they sometimes buried the corpses,
though no descriptions of such skeletons have appeared. They made vast
quantities of pottery, much of it painted, some of it incised, but they
were ignorant of the potter&rsquo;s wheel. They cultivated the land, at any
rate during their later phase, for half-cooked corn has been found among
their remains.</p>

<p>This culture is found throughout south-western Russia, south of
the Pripet marshes, and west of the Dnieper; it is sometimes found
extending, too, east of that river in the governments of Chernigov and
Poltava. Southward it is found throughout the steppe region of Rumania,
while westward it extends through the open country as far as Breslau.
Pottery somewhat resembling that of the Tripolje culture has been found
in Serbia, Thrace, Thessaly and the north-west corner of Asia Minor.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 2.<br />
POTSHERD FROM KOSZYLOWSCE, GALICIA.</p>
</div>

<p>The Tripolje culture is of two types, known as A and B. Judging by the
pottery, and the terracotta figures of women, which are fairly common on
both types of sites, the B culture is the more advanced. On the other
hand no metal has been found on these sites, while copper axes and
perforated stone axes are not uncommon on the sites exhibiting A culture.</p>

<p>When this culture was first discovered, it was believed by some that
here we had the origin of the early painted wares of Greece and
Crete,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> but later on the discoveries at Cnossos showed that at
that place painted pottery had developed from plain and incised wares;
it was also noticed that the shapes of the pots at these sites were
fundamentally different. So all idea of a connection between these two
industries was abandoned. There is, however, in the Newbury Museum a
potsherd of Tripolje ware, from Koszylowsce in Galicia, which bears
a very striking resemblance to another of the second early Minoan
period, from the <em>tholos</em> at Haghia Triada in Crete, figured by
Mosso.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> It may be, after all, that, while the suggestion that the
Tripolje ceramic is ancestral to that of Crete is erroneous, there
may have been some connection and mutual borrowing. This resemblance
and the presence of copper axes during period A suggests that there
had been trade relations, either direct or indirect, between Crete
and the north-western shore of the Euxine, between 2600 and 2400
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and this fits in very well with the trade between Egypt
and Transylvania, about 3200 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, to which reference was made
in chapter III. The Tripolje settlements of Type A belong, therefore, to
a period which closed certainly as early as 2400 and perhaps as early as
2600 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> For some reason, it would appear, this trade came to
an end about this time, and the importation of copper axes ceased.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> The
cause of this interruption is uncertain, but it is perhaps permissible
to suggest that the inhabitants of Hissarlik II., like their successors
in Hissarlik VI., held the straits and so restricted the traffic through
it as to kill it. The disappearance of the type A culture must certainly
be equated approximately with the rise of Hissarlik II., for, as we
shall see, the disappearance of Type B. culture practically synchronises
with the destruction of that city.</p>

<p>As we have seen this people usually, and perhaps invariably cremated
their dead, for the skeletons referred to by M. Chvojka,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> may not
have belonged to this period; in any case they have not been described.
We have, therefore, no direct evidence of their physical characters and
racial affinities. Some years ago Sir Arthur Keith,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> discussing the
origin of the &ldquo;Bronze age invaders of Britain,&rdquo; a people which I shall
describe in the next chapter by the name of the Beaker-folk, argued with
much force that they must have set out from Galicia. As they reached
Britain about or perhaps before 2000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, they must have left
Galicia still earlier, that is to say about the time that Tripolje
settlements of type B. came to an end. For this reason I argued in
1916<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> that the Tripolje culture was due to the Beaker-folk, and I
see no reason to-day to change my mind.</p>

<p>Now the Beaker-folk, often called Bronze Age or Round Barrow men, are
rather tall, strongly built, and with rather broad heads. They have
often been termed Alpine, but as Keith has shown, they differ in many
important particulars from the typical Alpines in the mountain zone.
The difference lies mainly in this: they are taller, more robust, their
cranial index is lower, seldom rising above 84, while the conspicuous
flattening of the occiput is absent.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>These characters suggest a cross between the Alpine and Nordic types,
and this is a possible solution, as they lie midway between the Alpines
of the mountain zone and another people, to be described next, who
occupied the steppe lands to the east, and who closely resemble the
Nordic type. On the other hand the Beaker-folk type seems to have
remained fairly uniform, so that, if it is a cross, it is a stable
cross, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> suggests that it is one of long standing. It may be, then,
that we should consider it rather as a cross between the broad-headed
Ofnet type, and some long-headed pal√¶olithic race, such as that of Combe
Capelle.</p>

<p>On the steppe lands east of the Dnieper, and stretching thence to the
confines of Asia, and apparently beyond into Turkestan, we find evidence
of another people, who are of great importance to our problem.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
Unfortunately we know less of them than we could wish, for many of
their remains have come to light as the result of unscientific digging,
and the few results of expert exploration have been meagrely published
in very unaccessible proceedings. These people buried their dead in
barrows, or kurgans, and for this reason they have been called Kurgan
people.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> This name, however, is open to objection, as several other
folk at different times have buried in kurgans throughout this region.
The chief peculiarity of the people I am dealing with is that they
buried their dead in a contracted position, and that skeletons have been
found thickly covered with red ochre. For this reason some writers have
called them red skeleton men or nomad red men.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> This again is not
quite a satisfactory term, and I have suggested in its place steppe-folk
or nomad steppe-folk.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>The graves of these men were poorly furnished. They contained usually
a few stone or bone implements and a certain type of pot with a
hemispherical base. The evidence available a few years ago led to the
belief that they were in a neolithic condition and totally ignorant of
the use of metal, but some recent discoveries at Maikop, in the Koban
basin, disclosed a considerable number of objects of gold and silver.
From this and similar finds Rostovtzeff<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> has argued that these
steppe-folk were responsible for a considerable civilisation; but,
taking into account the poverty displayed by most of their burials,
I am disposed to think of them as still living in a neolithic state,
but sometimes raiding the richer and more advanced civilisations to
the south, which had long reached a chalcolithic stage. Rostovtzeff
is probably right in attributing the Maikop discoveries to the early
part of the third millennium, which brings them within the period we are
discussing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>That these people were nomads seems clear from the little evidence we
possess and from the poverty of their tombs and the absence of dwelling
sites. We have, in one grave at least, evidence that they possessed
the horse,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and since the grassy steppe lands are the home of wild
cattle, we shall not be far wrong in believing that they were by this
time passing from a hunting to a pastoral stage. They were, in fact,
owners of large bands of cattle, which, like cow-boys, they drove from
pasture to pasture.</p>

<p>Professor Myres has argued for a very wide distribution of these
people, in fact from the Elbe to Tobolsk, and southwards to Bosnia
and Thrace.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Some of these extensions seem, as we shall see, to
date from a later period, and during the time which we are discussing,
roughly the period of Hissarlik II., the bulk of them seem to have been
restricted to the steppe regions east of the Dnieper, though they roamed
the belt of parkland lying to the north, and perhaps even penetrated the
dense woodland beyond. How far they had extended eastward is uncertain,
but, as we shall see in the next chapter, their more distant excursions
in this direction may well have been later.</p>

<p>We know something of their physical type. Bogdanov tells us that they
were a robust race, with a large and long head, an elongated face, and,
according to some examples, with hair more or less fair.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> The colour
of the hair has been disputed, as there is a tendency for hair in graves
to become pale. The cranial index is not quite certain. Sergi states
that it varies from 65 to 81,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> but it seems likely that among his
collection of kurgan skulls are some of other types. Bogdanov tells us
that in the kurgans to the west of the area several broad skulls occur,
but with less robust skeletons, and the average index is higher. This
may be due to admixture with Alpine or Beaker types. In the north, too,
as one approaches the middle valley of the Volga, the broad type appears
also; in this case I have suggested that it is due to admixture with a
Mongoloid type which was already occupying this region.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> From the
kurgans at Souja,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> in the government of Kursk, where the steppe
lands reach further north than elsewhere, came twenty-three skulls
which showed singular uniformity; nineteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> of these were markedly
long headed, and the remainder, belonging to three women and a child,
only a trifle less so. It is possible that a considerable variation
of head-form existed among these people, especially on the outskirts
of their region, where they seem to have come into contact with more
broad-headed neighbours. But Bogdanov is probably right in concluding
that the pure type was a long-headed one, though the skulls seem not to
have been so narrow as was frequently the case among the Mediterranean
peoples of the west. Normally the length-breadth index seems to have
varied from 73 to 76 though both higher and lower indices have sometimes
been found.</p>

<p>The most striking feature about this people is the custom of covering
the skeleton, or the body, with red ochre.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> It has been suggested
that this arose from the body being buried in clothes and cap of skin,
deeply impregnated with this pigment. This custom is widespread, and, as
we have seen, was not uncommon in the upper pal√¶olithic age, being found
at the beginning of the Aurignacian period in the case of the Grimaldi
skeletons found buried in the <em>Grotte des enfants</em>. We seem here to be
in the presence of the survival of a custom which dates from the times
of Aurignac.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that during the closing phases of the Aurignacian
period the Combe Capelle type makes its appearance in western Europe,
and about the same time arrived the horse, which was hunted for food. A
little later, when steppe conditions had become better established in
the west, we have the great Solutrean invasion which drove the artistes
of the Dordogne to the Pyrenees. The Combe Capelle type seems to have
been predominant during this period, and the Br√ºnn skeletons, one of
which was of this type, were covered with red ochre.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> As the climate
deteriorated, and tundra conditions prevailed, the Solutrean invaders
departed, apparently to the east.</p>

<p>Until a large number of the skulls of our steppe-folk, found in the
kurgans, can be compared with the relatively few crania of the Combe
Capelle type which have survived from the upper pal√¶olithic age, it
would be dangerous to come to any conclusion, but the evidence cited
above makes it reasonable to suggest that perhaps the long-headed
hunters of the horse, with their fine laurel-leaf spears, may have
retreated to the steppe lands of South Russia and Turkestan, and there
converted the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> which they had hunted and ate into a means
whereby they could roam with greater ease and rapidity over the grassy
plains. The subjugation of the horse would have rendered easier the
domestication of cattle, which in turn changed them from hippophagists
to beef-eaters. Their robustness and long-headedness, combined with
their roaming instincts and devotion to the horse, which will become
clearer as we proceed, have convinced me that we are here dealing with
that tall, fair, long-headed type, now dominant in northern Europe,
which we term the Nordic race.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smaller">HAT</span> large tracts of
Asia have been subject to a gradual process of
desiccation has been made clear to us by the reports of the successive
explorations of Sir Aurel Stein, who has shown us that regions, which
are now uninhabited desert, once held a flourishing population. It
has been suggested by Ellsworth Huntington,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> who accompanied the
Pumpelly expedition to Turkestan, that the process of desiccation
has been neither continuous nor progressive, but has been subject to
intermittent action and the alternation of dry and wet periods. The
evidence which he has adduced of the rise and fall of the level of
the Caspian sea seems to bear out his thesis, which has been further
strengthened by his later observations in Palestine and on the shores of
the Dead Sea.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>It is part of Ellsworth Huntington&rsquo;s hypothesis that during these
periods of drought, or light precipitation, the population of the
steppe lands, which had grown in numbers during the previous years of
heavier rainfall, have found it difficult to obtain adequate pasturage
for their flocks and herds, and have in consequence dispersed to more
favoured regions. To this he attributes the great raids from the steppe
and desert into the more fertile zones adjoining them, which have been
so marked a feature in the history of the Near East. He points out that
a relatively small diminution of rainfall may make all the difference
between a sufficient and inadequate crop of grass, and should the crop
be insufficient, the flocks and herds, the sole means of support for the
steppe-folks, would inevitably perish unless driven to moister regions.
How serious even one dry year may be has recently been brought home to
us by the Russian famine in 1921.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>This thesis has been severely attacked, especially by Peisker.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
Still, though Huntington&rsquo;s conclusions may require modification in
detail, his main contention seems to have withstood the attacks made
upon it. Mr. Brooks<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> has recently shown us that the climate of
Europe has passed through considerable changes since the ice age, and
that such changes come down to relatively recent times and may yet be
in progress. He attributes these largely to changes in coast line, and
to the relative masses of land and water. The Pumpelly reports<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
show that considerable changes of level have taken place in Turkestan,
and but small changes are needed to connect the Aralo-Caspian basin, by
means of the Obi valley, with the Arctic Ocean. All this tends to show
that we may expect considerable variation in the climate of this region,
while Huntington&rsquo;s evidence of changes in the level of the Caspian Sea
seems to prove that such variations have not been always in the same
direction. Mr. Cook is, however, inclined to see in this the destruction
of forests and their conversion into grass-lands by the primitive
process of cultivation which he terms Milpa agriculture.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>It is to periods of light rainfall that Huntington attributes the four
great irruptions from the Arabian desert which have been recognised by
Semitic scholars,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> the last of which spread the doctrine of Islam
over the Near East; to the same cause he attributes, too, the various
movements of the Huns and Tartars. One may reasonably add to this that
even one dry year during the period of light rainfall may be sufficient
to account for such an exodus.</p>

<p>Now, as I have endeavoured to show on a previous occasion,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> such a
period of light rainfall seems to have occurred between 2400 and 2200
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, though it may have been of somewhat longer duration. I
further gave reason for believing that about 2225 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, or
perhaps a little earlier, an invasion of nomads took place from the
Russian steppes. It would seem that about this time the Tripolje culture
came suddenly to an end, and from the evidence at Khalepje,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Minns
was inclined to believe that it had been destroyed by the steppe-folk,
who had buried one of their dead on the site formerly occupied by a
Tripolje &ldquo;area.&rdquo; This destruction has recently been questioned, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
it has been suggested that the Tripolje people may have abandoned
this region, driven out rather by drought than by the attacks of the
steppe-folk.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, for further excavations are needed before the
question can be determined, there is no doubt that these nomads
disappeared from the steppe for a time and were found in the Tripolje
region. Further we have evidence that a people resembling them appeared
soon afterwards in Thessaly, bringing with them pottery which appears to
be derived from that of the Tripolje culture.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Others of this type
seem to have been responsible for the destruction of Hissarlik II.,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
while pottery, which also shows affinities with that of Tripolje, occurs
later at Hissarlik and at Yortan on the Caicus.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Moreover, the
kurgans, characteristic of these steppe-folk, have been found all over
Thrace and even over Asia Minor from the Hellespont southwards to Lydia
and Caria, as well as eastwards up the Sangarius into the plateau of
Phrygia.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Thus we seem to be dealing with an advance of a steppe
people, comparable with the various irruptions from the Arabian desert
which did so much to change the course of history in Mesopotamia, and
destroyed the Old and Middle Kingdoms in Egypt.</p>

<p>A further corroboration comes from Turkestan, from the mounds of Anau.
In the south kurgan, the lower layers belonged to the period known as
Anau III., which contained a copper culture and a three-sided seal,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
which Mrs. Hawes recognised as having Middle Minoan affinities.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
This settlement, which seems to have been in touch with the Elamite
culture of Susa,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> came suddenly to an end at a date which Pumpelly
fixes at about 2200 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Whether the settlement was
destroyed or merely abandoned is not quite clear, but what is important
for our purpose is that two agricultural communities on the edge of the
steppe, those of Tripolje and Anau, came to an end at exactly or almost
exactly the same date.</p>

<p>I have also suggested<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> that in this last case we may perhaps see
some proof of an hypothesis, advanced many years ago from legendary and
linguistic data by Terrien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> de Lacouperie.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> This ingenious author,
who had been dead many years before the discoveries at Anau were made,
suggested that certain tribes, settled near the Caspian Sea, whom he
called the Bak tribes and who had been under the influence of the kings
of Elam, left their settlements about 2200 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and set out
on a long trek towards China, into which land they introduced the
beginnings of culture and the germs of the Chinese script.</p>

<p>This hypothesis was badly received when it appeared. Few of its critics
had taken the trouble to master Lacouperie&rsquo;s argument, which was
advanced in a most confused style. Sir Robert Douglas,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> however, a
sinologist of no mean reputation, believed that there was a considerable
amount of truth at the bottom of it, though the theory was overlaid by
many fanciful conjectures. Recently M. Cordier<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> has dismissed the
whole idea as imaginary and based on inaccurate linguistic data. The
question, I venture to think, needs re-examination, for at Anau we find
a settlement of peasants, in touch with the Elamites, abandoning their
village just at the date suggested by Lacouperie.</p>

<p>All this evidence seems to point to the fact that owing to drought,
either of a prolonged order or lasting for two or three consecutive
summers, our steppe-folk, who buried their dead in a contracted position
covered with red ochre, suddenly left the steppe lands between the
Dnieper and the Asiatic frontier, and dispersed in search of wetter
regions and richer pastures. Two settled agricultural civilisations on
their borders, the Tripolje settlements in the Ukraine and those at
Anau, disappeared at the same time, driven out either by the drought or
by the advancing hordes.</p>

<p>That some went to the east as well as to the west seems probable, for
we find not long afterwards, in the reign of Hammurabi, 2123&ndash;2061
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, bands of steppe-folk on the Iranian plateau, who had
already tamed the horse.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> These entered Mesopotamia and established
the Kassite dynasty about 1760 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> and were the first to
introduce the horse into the valley of the Tigris.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Whether or no
other bands passed further to the eastward we have no positive evidence,
but, as we have seen, there seem to be reasons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> for suspecting that some
reached Tobolsk,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> and there were at one time fair people dwelling
in the upper basin of the Yenesei<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>. It seems probable that it is to
this period that we must attribute this easterly movement. As it seems
probable that the Mitanni barons, who were lording it over eastern
Armenia, were of the same stock as the Kassites, we may attribute
their arrival south of the Caspian to the same causes. Geographical
considerations, too, would lead us to suspect that ample pasturage could
have been found also among the hills surrounding Balkh.</p>

<p>The westward movements I have already dealt with elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and
I need do no more than recapitulate them here. As we have seen, the
steppe-folk entered the Tripolje region, and probably occupied this
district as far as Breslau. Some of them passed southwards along the
western shore of the Euxine, and crossing the Danube, settled in Thrace,
where numerous kurgans are to be seen.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Others seem to have passed
on further south, and eventually reached the Thessalian plain, into
which they introduced Dhimini ware and the cult of the horse. It may
be that it was the appearance of these strange horsemen in this region
which gave rise to the stories of the Centaurs.</p>

<p>Some bands of the latter party seem to have separated from the main body
and advanced down the Gallipoli peninsula. These, as I have endeavoured
to show elsewhere, destroyed Hissarlik II., among the ruins of which two
of their skulls were found.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> It may be that these were responsible
for the rude villages of Hissarlik III., but it seems more probable that
they would have passed on to the grassy steppes in the interior of the
Anatolian peninsula.</p>

<p>Now the bulk of the people of Asia Minor at this date, as at the present
day, were of that eastern Alpine, Anatolian or Armenoid type, best
represented by the modern Armenians. These people are not by nature
warlike, though they will sometimes fight well to defend their homes;
but in no case are they aggressive, unless under the command of a more
militaristic type. A few centuries after the events which we have
been discussing, we find an aggressive, military power growing up in
the peninsula, at first under several chiefs or kings,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> in which,
I think, we may see a military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> aristocracy. These separate, though
perhaps federated, states ultimately coalesced into the great empire
of the Khatti or Hittites, who attacked and sacked Babylon in 1746
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Whether or no any of these steppe-folk entered Hungary at this time is
not quite clear, for it would seem that some of the long skulls found
at Laibach may be of an earlier date. To these we will return later.
It seems probable that the grassy steppes of the Hungarian plain would
tempt these wandering horsemen, and we can scarcely believe that they
would have avoided such rich pastures, unless, indeed, they were already
occupied by their distant relatives, who were powerful enough to keep
them out. The balance of evidence seems, however, to suggest that,
whether or no any Nordic steppe-folk had arrived here earlier, some of
these invaders from the steppes must have entered the fertile plain of
the middle Danube.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out by Minns,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> that &ldquo;in the far west of Russia,
between the Carpathians and Kiev, we find in the neolithic period
distinct traces of connection with the coasts of the Baltic,&rdquo; also that
there are found &ldquo;northern types of axes and amber.&rdquo; Zaborowski,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
also has drawn attention to the resemblance between some of the contents
of the kurgans and the culture by the shores of the Baltic. It was for
this reason that in 1916 I suggested<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> that at a date prior to that
we have been discussing, perhaps about 3000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, some of
these steppe-folk had passed to the shores of the Baltic, and were the
long-headed men who are found occupying the lowlands of Belgium<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
about that time. I have elaborated the argument since,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> but it has
not met with the approval of some of the Swedish arch√¶ologists.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
With the evidence at present available it is not easy to make a
conclusive case one way or the other, but, as we have seen, the
neolithic culture of this area resembles in some points that of the
Baltic, Nordic types appear in the Baltic region, in Belgium, in the
Rhine basin and pass thence to the Swiss lake-dwellings, while other
long-headed types, which may however have appeared later, are found in
the west of Hungary and the eastern slopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> of the mountain zone. All
these points lead one to suspect that at an earlier date some of these
Nordic steppe-folk, driven doubtless by a former period of drought, had
migrated north-westwards to the colder regions around the Baltic Sea,
where the type, already tall, relatively fair and long-headed, developed
later these characters to a more pronounced degree.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 5.&mdash;SILVER VASE FROM HISSARLIK ii.</p>
</div>

<p>We have seen that the Tripolje people had departed from the Ukraine and
Galicia, driven away by drought or by the invading steppe-folk. Traces
of pottery, bearing some resemblances of that of the Tripolje culture,
have been found in various places to the south, just those places
where we find that our steppe-folk had settled. This suggests that the
steppe-folk had conquered these people, and taken captive some of their
women,<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> who in all primitive tribes are the potters.</p>

<p>If Keith is right that our Beaker-folk came from Galicia, we must
suppose that on leaving the Ukraine they passed westward and entered
Bohemia, for it is from this country, as Lord Abercromby has shown,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
the northern beaker seems to have been derived.</p>

<p>But Leeds has lately suggested,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and this suggestion was also made
some years ago by Sir Arthur Evans,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> that the beaker developed
originally in Spain. Leeds has published a map, showing that beakers of
the earliest type are found most abundantly in Andalusia, and he traces
their distribution thence throughout west Europe. One of his lines of
migration carried them to north Italy, where it points to the Brenner
Pass.</p>

<p>Now the Spanish and western beakers differ in many important respects
from the northern type, though it is characteristic of both to be
decorated with parallel and horizontal bands of ornament. Leeds thinks
that the beaker developed in Spain from a type of pot, which he terms
carinated, and which is found associated with megalithic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> monuments
at such distant points as Denmark, the Isle of Arran, Guernsey and
Brittany, the Pyrenees, Spain, Algeria, Taranto, Sicily and Malta. This
type of pot is distinguished by having a hemispherical base, while the
sides, half way up, have a knee or angle, above which they are concave.</p>

<p>Now it is of course possible that the bell-beaker of Spain may be
derived from this carinated vase, though intermediate forms seem to be
lacking. I am inclined to think, however, that this beaker has a double
parentage, and has been influenced, too, by certain types of ware not
uncommon at Hissarlik II., the form of which is best shown by a silver
vase found in that city.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 6.<br />
BELL BEAKER.</p>
</div>

<p>However this may be, the bell-beaker, which has invariably a convex
base, seems to have been evolved in Andalusia, and to have been carried,
amongst other places, to North Italy, and thence northward to Bohemia,
where it is localised in the western part of that province. Here another
type of pottery, called cord vases, which had developed in the plain
of North Germany, had been already introduced, and the northern type
of beaker, which has a flat base, seems to have been derived from a
combination of both types.</p>

<p>Some years ago Dr. O. Reche<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> described a people, very closely
resembling the Beaker-folk, as inhabiting Silesia and especially Bohemia
during the closing phases of the megalithic period in the Baltic, that
is to say about the time we are considering. Into this population there
intruded invaders of the Nordic type, exterminating the men but marrying
the women and adopting their customs. These invaders entered Silesia in
force, but only penetrated into Bohemia in small numbers.</p>

<p>This seems to point to the fact that some of our Tripolje people were,
as we have seen before, occupying Silesia, while others had settled
in Bohemia. Here they were using,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> and had perhaps taken over from an
earlier people, a type of beaker, which had been developed from the
cord pottery of northern Europe, influenced by a few imported specimens
of the bell-beaker, which had come ultimately from Spain. Soon the
steppe-folk, passing through Galicia and southern Silesia, entered
Bohemia, and some, at any rate, of the Beaker-folk moved northwards.
Lord Abercromby<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> has shown how they left through the Elbe gap and
passed northwards between the valleys of the Weser and the Rhine. Some
went further north to Jutland, where we find them introducing the single
grave culture, characterised by the presence of beakers and those
perforated stone axes, which we have met with before in the Tripolje
area.</p>

<p>Others passed into the low countries, where they occupied the region
lying between Utrecht and Gelderland in the south and Drenthe in the
north.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Thence some passed to this country. Lord Abercromby believes
that they crossed the channel at the narrowest point, and passed
westward and northward by land.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> It seems more likely, however,
that though the crossing may actually have been made by the Straits of
Dover, the Beaker-folk coasted along the southern and eastern shores of
Great Britain, for maritime traffic was no new thing in these parts.
Some, who landed near the Moray Frith, seem to have been accompanied by
a few pure Alpines,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> whose blood has left a marked effect on the
present population of Aberdeenshire.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> While they settled in the
upland regions of England and Scotland, especially on the open downs
and limestone hills, they penetrated very little to the west, which was
dominated by the Prospectors. Few signs of their presence appear in
Wales, and none that can be depended upon in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>It has been thought by some that they spoke some form of Aryan or
Indo-European tongue, and it has been conjectured that it was they who
introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> into these isles the Goidelic or Gaelic dialects. This
opinion has recently been restated by M. Loth.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> This view has been
well answered by Rice Holmes,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> and his arguments are as valid to-day
as when they were written. We are forced to admit that we are in total
ignorance of the language spoken by the Beaker-folk.</p>

<p>It was at one time believed that they introduced into this country
the knowledge of bronze, and graphic pictures were drawn of the way
in which, with their superior weapons, they conquered the stone-using
aborigines. Few, however, of their graves, either here or in Jutland,
contain objects of metal, and those which have been met with seem to
conform more to south-western than to Central European types.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> It
must not, however, be assumed too hastily that they were in complete
ignorance of metal, though they did not possess implements of that
material on their arrival; for, as we have seen, the Tripolje people, in
their period A, had used copper axes, doubtless carried thither by √Ügean
traders, and the perforated axes, used in the Ukraine, as in Jutland
and Britain, seem as though copied from metal originals. It would be
more accurate to say that a tradition of the former use of metal may
have lingered among them, as of an article once possessed but long since
lost.</p>

it has been suggested, from the Russian steppes. It is also more than
probable that fresh invaders from the steppes arrived about 2200
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, especially in the Hungarian plain. Thus, though the
population of the whole of the area, which we have termed the Celtic
cradle, was to some extent alike, there were considerable differences,
both in the proportion of racial elements and in the methods of life,
between the people of the mountain zone and the inhabitants of the plain.</p>

<p>Though members of both the Alpine and Nordic races inhabited the
mountain zone, and are found living together in the same villages,
they appear not to have intermarried, at any rate to any considerable
extent, for at a much later date we find skulls both of the long-headed
and the broad-headed types, but few if any which show evidence of mixed
ancestry.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> The evidence obtained from the cemetery at Hallstatt,
which dates from 1000 years or more later, seems to point to the same
conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>Now the Alpine people, as we have seen, are thrifty, steady,
hard-working tillers of the soil, patient but lacking in the spirit
of adventure. The Nordics, on the other hand, are strong, active,
courageous and adventurous, devoted to the horse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> accustomed on its
back to drive bands of cattle over the grassy steppes. If we may judge
from the views of many of their modern representatives, they despise
menial work, such as ploughing the land or digging the soil, just as
they prefer cattle and beef to sheep or mutton, and have a contempt for
fish-eaters and vegetarians. The Nordic also has a natural instinct for
governing and administration.</p>

<p>As I have shown elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> if two such peoples come into contact,
and settle down together, there can be but one result: the Nordic
becomes a lord and his people a privileged nobility, while the Alpine
becomes eventually a serf. With a strong racial exclusiveness, or, as
we call it to-day, colour prejudice, the Nordics decline to take wives
from the subject class, and, though irregular unions may in time take
place, marriage is strictly forbidden. In this we have the germs of
the caste system so well known in India. Similar objections to such
inter-marriages are a marked feature of the Briton throughout the
empire. This custom has given rise to the strict marriage regulations,
which existed until lately among all royal and many noble families
in Europe, and among the descendants of the Visigoths in Spain. The
marriage laws of Athens and Rome seem to imply a similar point of view.
Another steppe-folk, entering a mountain zone filled with an eastern
Alpine population, issued a similar edict, which they credited to their
tribal god.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Thus in the mountain zone Nordic and Alpine lived
together, apparently in harmony, as lord and serf, never intermarrying
and rarely, if ever, mating with one another.</p>

</div>

<p>In the plain, however, the Alpines seem to have been absent, or at any
rate few in number. Here we may well imagine the Nordics continued their
nomadic existence, driving their cattle from one pasture to another.
Thus the population tended to divide into two groups, the people of the
mountains and the people of the plain.</p>

<p>When the first group of Nordics arrived in this region, both they and
their Alpine predecessors were ignorant of metal, but a few centuries
later implements of copper began slowly to penetrate the whole area.
Perhaps these arrived from the east, up the Danube valley, either from
Hissarlik II. or from those √Ügean merchants, who, as we have seen, were
trading for Transylvanian gold, or taking copper axes to the Tripolje
folk. Or it may be that other √Ügean folk had by this time reached the
head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> of the Adriatic, and were making their way thence to the mines
of the Erz-gebirge and the amber coasts of the Baltic. It is probable
that both lines of trade began fairly early in the third millennium, and
the general course of the latter route can be traced in outline from
Fiume, along the eastern foothills of the mountain zone towards Linz,
where the Danube must have been crossed in dug-out canoes; thence it
continued through the Elbe gap, and on by various routes, indicated by
the distribution of flat celts, to the amber coast.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>One thing is clear, and that is that metal reached the mountain zone
from the east and not from the west. It was at one time believed that
when metal first appeared in the western Mediterranean, the Rhone valley
was the main line of approach into Central Europe.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> This we now
know was not the case,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> for that valley was thickly wooded, and
the inhabitants of most of it remained in a neolithic state until many
centuries after metal had become known in Switzerland.</p>

</div>

<p>After the destruction of Hissarlik II. communications from the east seem
to have ceased for a time; the irruption of the steppe-folk appears to
have interfered with trade, especially by land, over the north √Ügean
and Euxine areas. Perhaps, too, after the arrival of fresh hordes of
steppe-folk into Hungary trade by the other route may also have ceased
for a time. There is some evidence that this was the case, but in due
course it was resumed, and was at any rate in full swing again long
before 1600 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, though, judging by the type of weapons found,
this trade was rather with Italy and the west than with the √Ügean and
the eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p>We have seen in an earlier chapter that the people of the Mediterranean
had developed a type of dagger of a somewhat triangular form, made first
of all of copper and subsequently of bronze. This dagger, as we have
seen, frequently had concave sides, perhaps at first as the result of
constant grinding, and thus attained an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> ogival form. We have noted
also that the breadth of the butt diminished as the length of the blade
increased. Sometimes, especially in North Italy, the sides remained
straight, and grooves were cut in the blade parallel to the sides. The
object of these grooves, which were three, five or even more in number,
was not in the first instance a question of ornament, though in time it
became the <em>motif</em> of an elaborate decoration. In the first instance it
had a severely practical value, for a dagger so grooved, thrust into the
body of an enemy, could be more readily extracted than one of which the
whole surface was smooth. This grooving began with the straight-sided
daggers, but was afterwards applied to those of ogival form.</p>

<p>The people of the Mediterranean race were, as we have seen, rather short
and of slight build, and their daggers were relatively small. They were
not used very frequently, we may imagine, in open warfare, but were more
usually employed to stab an enemy in the back, a custom not yet obsolete
in some Mediterranean lands. The handle was of bronze, often handsomely
chased, and sometimes decorated with thin plates of gold. Such handles
were riveted on to the blades, and so long as the butt of the latter
was wide and the blade not too long, this method of attachment proved
satisfactory. But, as we have seen, the tendency was for the butt to
diminish in breadth and the blade to increase in length, which suggests
that open combat was becoming more fashionable or more necessary,
and that a greater reach was needed. The narrowing of the area of
attachment, and the lengthening of the blade, threw an ever increasing
strain on the riveted joint, which must have become more and more
ineffective. Still, the Mediterranean peoples up to the last, except in
the √Ügean area, continued to use this long dirk, or rapier, with riveted
handle.</p>

</div>

<p>But the trade with Hungary carried these daggers from Italy into Central
Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> and the Nordic inhabitants, both of the plain and of the
mountains, were good customers. But being big men, with large hands and
accustomed to meet their foes face to face, they demanded larger and
larger daggers, and this demand was met, as such a demand always is,
by an adequate supply. Thus we find these weapons, closely resembling
those in use in the Mediterranean basin, especially in its western
half, becoming increasingly common in Hungary, and growing to greater
and greater dimensions. Plate IV. shows five daggers found in Hungary:
the two first can be matched both in Greece and Italy and elsewhere
in the Mediterranean region, the third in Italy only, the fourth in
the northern part of that peninsula, while the fifth is rare outside
Hungary, and I have only been able to find one parallel, from Bondo in
the Grisons.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>The increased size of the daggers, which in some cases had grown to
enormous proportions, as may be seen in Plate V., made the weakness
at the riveted joint more apparent. The Nordics, fighters above all
else, paid much attention to their weapons, and they set themselves to
discover some way to overcome this difficulty. This led, as we shall
see, to the evolution of the leaf-shaped sword.</p>

<p>During the bronze age there were several types of sword in use
in various parts of the Old World. We have seen how the typical
Mediterranean sword or long dirk developed by slow degrees in the west
from the triangular copper daggers of Crete. In the √Ügean and in Greek
lands we find other types, which seem to be derived from swords of
Asiatic origin, and which had an independent development in Mesopotamia
or Egypt; some, too, may have been derived from the copper daggers of
Cyprus.</p>

<p>But there is one type or group which stands apart from the others. In
many examples the blade narrows rapidly near the butt, then expands
slowly till it reaches its greatest breadth about two-thirds of the
way down the blade; then it narrows more rapidly, then very quickly to
the point. This gives a shape not unlike the leaf of the lanceolate
plantain, a form not uncommon in other leaves; hence the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
leaf-shaped sword. But many examples from this group, in other respects
indistinguishable from those described, have sides which are nearly
parallel, sometimes quite so. To these cases the term leaf-shaped is not
so applicable. But the name is hallowed by a long tradition, and so it
will be well to retain it for the whole group.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 12.<br />
TANG, WITH FLANGED EDGES,<br />
SHAPED TO FIT THE HAND.</p>
</div>

<p>Leaf-shaped swords may be divided into two sub-groups: those with bronze
hilts or pommels, and those without. Owing to the beauty of their
decoration, the types with bronze hilts have hitherto received the
greatest amount of attention, and several arch√¶ologists have devoted
pages to describing them and tracing out their evolution.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> They are
not, however, very common outside Hungary, and in all cases are much
rarer than the other types. The details of their form lead us to believe
that they are contemporary with some, in fact with most of the other
types, and the elaborate decoration present in most cases shows us that
they were an expensive and ornate form, used probably by the greater
chieftains, while the other types were the cheap and plain weapons used
either by the lesser nobles or by the rank and file.</p>

<p>The simpler type of sword has no bronze hilt, but in its place a long
tang, usually but not invariably with flanged edges, and shaped to fit
the hand. This tang is pierced by several rivet holes, in which the
rivets are sometimes found adhering, and these rivets were used to
secure on either side of the tang pieces of wood, bone or horn, which
with it formed the hilt. In some cases such swords have been found with
wood or horn still attached. These are obviously a cheaper form of
hilt, and it is not surprising that such swords are more commonly found
and more widely distributed than those with bronze hilts or pommels,
notwithstanding that the latter have been more eagerly sought after by
collectors.</p>

<p>It is partly because these types, which are all included in the Type
II. of Naue,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> are commoner and more widely distributed that I have
selected them for special study in preference to the more ornate forms,
but also for another reason. It has hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> been usual to classify
swords mainly by the shapes of their blades or their sections; for
reasons which will become apparent as I proceed, I am proposing a new
classification, based upon the shape of the butt of the blade, the
portion, that is to say, which immediately adjoins the handle-shaped
tang.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 13.&mdash;CONVEX AND CONCAVE BUTTS.</p>
</div>

<p>Now if we examine a large number of swords of these types, we shall
find that these butts vary in form, some being convex and others
concave. In Plate VI. I have placed them in a series of seven, and it
would, perhaps, be possible to sub-divide them more minutely, and to
give several variants of most of the types. For reasons, which will, I
think, be apparent to anyone consulting the Plate, and which I give more
fully below, I believe Type A to be the earliest of the series; Type G,
on the other hand, occurs in the famous cemetery at Hallstatt, in the
Salzkammergut, and as iron swords and implements were found in most of
the graves there, we may consider these bronze swords as belonging to
the very last phase of the bronze age in Central Europe. As the butts
of the blades show a gradual transition from the form usual in the
daggers with riveted handles shown in Plate IV. to the Hallstatt type,
we may, I think, feel satisfied that we have placed our series in strict
chronological sequence.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<i>a.</i> A SECTION NOT UNLIKE THAT<br />

<i>b.</i> A RHOMBOID SECTION WITH<br />
CONCAVE SIDES.</p>
</div>

<p>A glance at Type A, especially as seen in full length in Plate VII.,
shows us at once that it is a transitional form, and that it has
grown out of an ogival dagger, similar to those given on Plate V. The
butt is of the same shape, being a flattened semicircle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> with the
horizontal radii considerably longer than the vertical. The upper part
of the blade, too, is of the same form, and the parallel incised lines
are survivals of the grooves already described. These show that the
prototype was of ogival shape. In two points only does it differ from
the ancestral form: the blade has been lengthened considerably, till its
form is of rather an unnatural shape, while at the other end a tang,
shaped to fit the hand, and with flanged edges, has been cast in one
piece with the blade. Here we have a leaf-shaped sword, it is true, but
with the greatest breadth relatively near to the butt, and the tang
flanged and with rivet holes to enable the wooden or horn sides to be
attached to form the hilt. The section is somewhat rhomboidal.</p>

<p>Now it has long been realised that swords of these types had been
evolved somewhere in the Danube basin, and it has been suggested that
this had taken place in the south Danubian region.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> It becomes
important, therefore, to determine whereabouts in the Celtic cradle
these types originated. Details of the distribution of this and of
other types will be discussed in the next chapter; here it will be
sufficient to summarise. As far as I have been able to ascertain, six
specimens only of this type are known, and one of these is so unlike
the others that we must look upon it as a later variant. Of the five,
one was found in the Friuli, at the head of the Adriatic, one in a tomb
in Schleswig-Holstein, while the other three were found somewhere in
Hungary. Of these the exact sites at which two were found are unknown,
but the third is said to have been dredged out of the Danube near
Buda-Pest.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 15.<br />

</div>

<p>We may, I think, conclude from this that it was in the plain of Hungary,
where the Nordic steppe-folk were living in relative purity, still
leading, perhaps, a nomadic life, that these swords were developed. The
origin seems to have been in the plain rather than in the mountain zone,
though subsequent types have been found frequently in the latter. It is
the Hungarian plain, then, we must consider as the centre of dispersal,
and, as far as possible, Hungarian rather than other examples will be
taken as the true types, of which others will be considered as variants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Now that the tang for the hilt had been cast in one piece with the
blade, and the attachment of the hilt no longer depended solely on the
row of rivets at the butt of the blade, there was no necessity for this
butt to be of so great a breadth. As a result we find in Type B the butt
has become approximately semi-circular, with the horizontal and vertical
radii equal. The flange on the sides of the tang remained, though in
some cases it became lighter and not so sharply modelled. The blades of
this type usually diminish gradually from below the butt to the point,
but occasionally we find a slight broadening of the blade into the true
leaf-shaped form. The numerous parallel grooves of Type A disappear, and
in their place appear a few, generally three, narrow grooves, very close
together, parallel to both sides of the blade, and dividing it into
three almost equal strips. Towards the butt these grooves bend outwards
to the edge, forming an almost perfect quadrant. Sometimes these grooves
are combined into one, and result in sharp lines dividing the blade into
three; in these cases the central third is much thicker than the two
sides, and the section is not unlike that of a spear-head. Occasionally
we find these parallel lines entirely absent, and the blade sloping to
a median ridge, thus forming in section a rhomboid with concave sides;
this variant is more common in the north, and seems to be a later local
development.</p>

</div>

<p>Types C and D are at first sight very much alike, but a close
examination of the critical part will explain the difference. We have
seen how in passing from Type A to Type B the horizontal radii diminish
until they equal the vertical; in Type C the vertical has increased
until it exceeds the horizontal, and an oval butt has developed.
The curves in this case seem to be nearly if not exactly those of
an ellipse. The flanges on the tang are still present, but tend to
disappear before reaching the point at which the butt passes into the
blade. The blades of this type sometimes retain their parallel sides,
but more often the breadth expands, usually about halfway between the
butt and the point. The lines of parallel grooving are tending to
disappear; they have been reduced as a rule to a single line on either
side, and although these are sometimes found in the same position as
in Type B, dividing the blade vertically into three equal strips, it
is more often the case that these lines have been moved nearer to the
edge, which in some cases they approach as close as fifty millimetres.
The blades in this type are relatively flat and thin, but the thickness
diminishes considerably outside the parallel lines. These lines, in
fact, are only indications of the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> where the diminished thickness
begins abruptly. In other cases the section is spindle-shaped.</p>

<p>Type D, as has been noted, closely resembles Type C, but the curves of
the oval, which were fairly true in Type C, have been much flattened.
In other respects it differs little from the more developed examples of
Type C. The spindle-shaped section appears to be more common.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 17.<br />

WITH MODIFIED EDGE.</p>
</div>

<p>In Type E the convexity of the butt has almost disappeared; the tang and
the butt blend more thoroughly, which makes the junction a larger hollow
curve than in the previous types. The sides of the butt are almost if
not quite straight, and the only trace of the original convexity is to
be found in the lower part of the butt, which terminates in a beak or
nose. The flanges of the tang are tending to disappear, and in many
cases are nothing but an irregular thickening of the parts nearest to
the outside. This type, as we shall see, is widely distributed, and
has developed many local variants, which can readily be recognised but
not easily described. The blade in this type, especially in the west,
usually displays the characteristic widening two thirds of the way down
the blade, which has given rise to the term leaf-shaped sword. The lines
parallel to the edge are always relatively near to it, in most cases
very near, and the blades are usually flatter and narrower, though the
spindle-shaped section still occurs.</p>

<p>Type F is that described by D√©chelette as Proto-Hallstatt, and in
many respects resembles Type G. The sides of the butt are straight or
slightly concave, and the head of the tang expands into a T-shaped
form. The flange has entirely disappeared and the rivet-holes in the
centre of the tang are frequently, though not invariably replaced by a
long slot. The conspicuous feature of this type and of Type G, though
it may occasionally be absent from Type F, is that the cutting edge
of the blade does not begin for an inch or two below the butt. The
illustrations will explain this better than any words can do, but the
point to note is that this portion, between the butt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> the true edge
of the blade, has a blunt edge, and gives the impression that something
has been tied round it. It may be that at this spot leather bands have
been attached, like the sword-knots of the modern swords and the leather
loops of policemen&rsquo;s batons; by holding this leather loop the weapon is
less likely to be snatched from the hand or lost.</p>

<p>Type G is the well-known Hallstatt type. In this the lines of the butt
have become definitely concave, the tang is thinner and always without
flanges, and terminates in a semi-hexagonal finial; the rivets, which
are usually found attached to the tang, are much smaller. The blade is
rather narrower than in most of the preceding types, but the widest part
is characteristically two-thirds of the way down the blade. The parallel
groove is close to the edge, and the edge ceases before reaching the
butt, as in the case of Type F. The section is spindle-shaped, with a
decided modification at the edge.</p>

<p>Some examples of Type G found in the west, especially in the British
Isles, vary in some details from the specimens found in Hallstatt. This
is especially the case with regard to the shape of the finial. But
speaking generally this type must have survived for a long time with
relatively little change, since it appears first in the oldest graves at
Hallstatt, while it is believed to have remained in use in this country
until the introduction of iron swords in the fifth century.</p>

<p>There are certain local variants of all or most of these types, and
it would be an interesting task to trace these out in all their
ramifications. To do so here would lead us too far away from the main
lines of our thesis, nor would it be easy to draw correct deductions
until drawings of all such swords found throughout Europe were
available. Here I must content myself with tracing out the broad lines
of the evolution of the leaf-shaped swords, and leave it to others to
work out the local varieties.</p>

<span class="s5">THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LEAF-SHAPED SWORDS.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smaller">E</span> have seen how the
leaf-shaped sword was evolved from the ogival
dagger in the plain of Hungary, and passed through a series of forms
until it reached the Hallstatt type, which gave way to the iron sword.
We must now consider the distribution of each type, which presents
certain peculiarities which are very instructive, and then consider how
it was that leaf-shaped swords, of one type or other, became dispersed
throughout the greater part of Europe, and reached, in some cases,
beyond the confines of that continent.</p>

<p>Let us first deal with Type A, the distribution of which was summarised
in the last chapter. A very fine example of this type is in the
Museum of Arch√¶ology and Ethnology at Cambridge; nothing is known,
unfortunately, of its provenance beyond the fact that it came from
Hungary. Another, almost identical, is in the National Museum at
Buda-Pest, and has been figured more than once,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> but the published
illustrations are not very accurate, and in Plate VII. I give one taken
from a drawing made from the original for this work. In this case, too,
the exact site is unknown. The third Hungarian specimen, a photograph of
which is in existence, was sold in London on 25th June, 1891. It was the
property of the late Dr. S. Egger, of Vienna, and the catalogue states
that it had been dredged from the Danube near Buda-Pest.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> These
are the only examples which I have met with which have been found in
Hungary, and I have been unable so far to trace the present ownership of
Dr. Egger&rsquo;s specimen.</p>

<p>Much more recently a very similar specimen, but with some slight
differences in the decoration, was found in the Friuli. It was dug up in
1909 by Antonio Tommassin, near Castions di Strada, in the district of
Palmanova, in the province of Udine, at a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> called Selve, at the
depth of about one metre. It is, or was, in the Museum at Cividale.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
Another, very unlike the others in decoration, and varying somewhat in
outline, was found in the neighbourhood of Treviso, north of Venice, and
is now in the Treviso Museum.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>Lastly we have one found in a grave somewhere in Schleswig-Holstein.
Splieth, who has recorded it, does not state exactly where it was found,
nor in what collection it was deposited at the time he was writing.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
He compares it with the second Hungarian specimen, but in reality it
more closely resembles that in the Museum at Cividale.</p>

<p>All these specimens, except that from Treviso, resemble one another so
closely that we may well believe that they were contemporary, and the
products of the same region; the type must have continued in use for
some little time in the Friuli, where it developed local variants like
the Treviso specimen.</p>

<p>Type B is rare in Hungary, or at any rate very few specimens occur in
the museums of that country. So far I have been able to find record
of only one, and this has been much damaged. It was found in 1884 in
a hoard at Orezi, in the county of Somogy.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> A somewhat unusual
form of this type is in the Vienna museum, but its provenance seems
unknown. In Italy one has been found at Ascoli Piceno,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> south of
Ancona, and Naue figures another from an unknown site. He mentions a
third, in his own collection, which is said to have come from Calabria,
but as he does not figure it one cannot be certain that this belongs
to Type B.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> I can find no instances of the occurrence of this
type in France, and though three specimens have been found in Britain
which bear a superficial resemblance to it, a more careful inspection
convinces me that they are local variants of a later type, perhaps C
or D. This type does not appear to occur in southern Germany, but the
swords of this region have not yet been catalogued with thoroughness.
It has been found, however, in the Baltic region, and specimens have
been recorded from Brandenburg, Pomerania and East Prussia.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> A
type closely resembling this occurs in Schleswig-Holstein and Denmark,
but most of the specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> show certain local features, some of which,
like the T-shaped finials, suggest a later date. In Schleswig-Holstein
Splieth mentions four examples,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> all isolated finds, which he dates
considerably later than his example of Type A.</p>

<p>Type C, with the oval butt, is relatively common in Hungary. I have been
able to trace at least eight specimens. Three of these are from unknown
sites,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> two from Kis-k√∂szey (Battina) in Baranza county,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> one
from Sajo-G√∂m√∂r,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> one from Hajdu-b√∂sz√∂rm√©ny in Hajdu county, which
was found with a hoard containing three of Type D,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> and one was
dredged up out of the Danube at St. Margaret&rsquo;s island in Buda-Pest.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
Two have been found in Lower Austria, one at Petronell,<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> east of
Vienna and the other, which was found in a barrow with a skeleton, a
long pin and two bracelets, at Winklarn.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> One has also been figured
by Dr. &#352;mid as having been found in Carniola, though its discovery
is not described in the text.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> In Italy one specimen has been found
near Lake Trasimene,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> a neighbourhood which has produced several
examples of Type D, but this type does not seem to have been found in
France, and only one very doubtful specimen is recorded for the British
Isles. This type seems also to be rare or absent from Germany, except
in the extreme north, for the only specimens which I can find recorded
are from Mecklenburg and Brandenburg.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> One or two have been recorded
from Denmark.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>Type D, as we have seen, does not differ much from Type C. It is one
of the commonest types found in Hungary, and I have been able to trace
seventeen examples. Of these two are from unknown sites,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> three
from the Hajdu-b√∂sz√∂rm√©ny hoard,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> from the hoard at Podhering
in the county of Bereg,<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> two from Sajo-G√∂m√∂r in the county of
G√∂m√∂r,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> two from Munkacs in Upper Hungary,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> one, found with
two of Type E, at Rima-Szombat in the county of G√∂m√∂r,<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> one from
Endrod in the county of B√©k√©s,<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> one, found with four others, from
Magyarorszag,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> one from Gross-Steffelsdorf near Sajo-G√∂m√∂r,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
one, found with a sword of Type E, from near Plattensee or Lake
Balaton,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> and one from the Danube near Buda-Pest.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>One has been found at B√ºrkanow in Galicia,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> one in Upper Austria,
one near Linz,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> five in Lower Austria, two at unknown sites, one
at Mannersdorf,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> one with a hoard including Type E swords at
Wollersdorf,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> and one in a wood near Wimpasting. One comes from
Gr√ºbegg near Aussee in Styria,<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> and two from Carniola, one of which
is from Mihovo near St. Barthelm√§, and the other from an uncertain
site.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Szombathy figures two fragments from a swallow-hole near St.
Kanzian, not far from Trieste.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>In Italy the type is of common occurrence, but in a definitely
restricted area. One has been found on the bank of the Chiano by the
bridge of Frassineto near Arezzo and is in the Arezzo museum,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> two
near Lake Trasimene,<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> where a specimen of Type C was found, one
of slightly aberrant form at Alerona, in the commune of Ficulle, near
Orvieto, and which is now in the Prehistoric Museum at Rome,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> and
another, which also presents unusual features, in Rome itself.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Two
specimens have been found at Lake Fucino,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> and a third close by at
Dintorni del Fucino,<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> one a little to the east at Sulmona,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> and
one rather further afield at Apulia.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Thus all these specimens, ten
of Type D and one of Type C, have been found in a very restricted area,
almost all of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> lying in a valley or rather a fold of the Apennines
between the lakes of Trasimene and Fucino. This distribution is of great
importance for our thesis and will be referred to again in a later
chapter.</p>

<p>This type has been found, though very rarely in France, and six
specimens have been recorded in Britain, all from the mouth of the
Thames, or from the south and east coasts. I can find no records of its
occurrence in Germany or Denmark.</p>

<p>But if Type D occurs rarely if at all in the west and north, we find
it not uncommonly in the south-east. Two swords of this type have been
found at Mycen√¶, one by Schliemann<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> and the other by Tsountas,<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
one has occurred at Levadia in Boeotia, a few miles south of Orchomenos,
while two more have been discovered in a grave at Muliana in Crete.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
The upper half of a sword, which has probably been influenced by this
type, though the butt and tang are different, comes from Cyprus, where
it was rifled from a tomb some thirty years ago.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Lastly, we have
records of two swords of this type from Egypt, both from the Delta.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
One of these, found at Zag-a-zig, is certainly of this type, the other,
found at Tell Firaun in the Delta, appears to be so also, but the butt
seems to have been slightly damaged. This sword bears upon it the
cartouch of Seti II., which seems to have been engraved upon it in or
about 1205 <em>B.C.</em> These occurrences of Type D swords in the south-east
are specially interesting, and will be referred to again, as they
give us some basis on which to establish a chronological scheme. They
may also help us to bring our arch√¶ological evidence into line with
historical and legendary matter.</p>

<p>Type E is also common in Hungary, from which eleven specimens have
been recorded. These usually attain to very great dimensions. One is
from an unknown site,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> three from Podhering, found with swords of
Type D,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> two from Rima-Szombat, also with swords of Type D,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
one from Magyarorbzag,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> one from Gyula-feh√©rvar in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> the county of
Fej√©r,<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> one from the Schatze near Hajdu-b√∂sz√∂rm√©ny,<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> one from
Oreszka in the county of Zempl√©n,<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> and one, also found with swords
of Type D, from near the Plattensee or Lake Balaton.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Three come
from Bohemia, from Gross-Tschernitz, Siebenburgen and Wodnian;<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> one
from Salza-Bach, near the Gr√ºbegg saw-mills in Styria,<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> and one
from a hoard, which contained swords of Type D, found at Wollersdorf in
Lower Austria.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> One comes from Zuojuica in Herzegovina and one was
found in a lake-dwelling at Auvernier on Lake Neuch√¢tel.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The type
also occurs in Germany, though, I believe, not plentifully. In Greece
two specimens only have been discovered, in a hoard outside the city of
Tiryns.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>None have been found in Italy, but in France they occur abundantly,
and there are thirty-one specimens of this type in the museum at St.
Germain-en-Laye. They occur more abundantly still in these islands;
fifty-eight have been found in the Thames basin, fifteen in the Fens,
many of these in the famous Wilburton hoard, while fourteen others come
from other counties washed by the North Sea; from the rest of England
and Wales only eleven have so far been noted. In Ireland this type has
not been found, but there are a considerable number of swords, found in
that island, which are intermediate between this type and Type F, and
will be dealt with under that heading.</p>

<p>It seems likely that some swords of this type have been found in the
Rhine Valley, but so far I have failed to find any recorded, while
elsewhere in Germany, in Schleswig-Holstein and in Denmark, they seem
to be absent. This type, as we have seen, is found mainly in the west,
so that it is extremely interesting to find a single example from an
eastern site. This was found at the village of Zavadyntse, near Gorodak,
in the government of Podolia in South-west Russia.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> The occurrence
of this sword so far east is strange, but taken in conjunction with the
distribution of a certain type of pin, with which I shall deal in a
later chapter, it will help to provide an important link in the chain of
our argument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>The most striking feature of the distribution of Type E is its sudden
appearance in Celtic lands, and in very great numbers. Up to this
date swords of these types have not been met with in the west, except
a few instances of Type D. As we must allow for a certain amount of
overlapping of successive types we may well believe that the few
examples of swords of Type D, found in Celtic lands, arrived there
during the time when Type E was the prevailing fashion.</p>

<p>Type F may be called the Proto-Hallstatt type. This has been found in
France, though not very commonly, and as far as I have been able to
test it mainly in the eastern departments, there are only two specimens
of this type in the St. Germain&rsquo;s museum. It occurs more commonly in
Switzerland, and it seems probable that it originated in that country,
or at least in the mountain zone of Central Europe. From this centre it
seems to have spread in various directions, though it is not possible at
present to trace its distribution with precision. One has been found in
Italy, at Povegliano, S.W. of Verona, which seems to have come from the
mountains over the Brenner pass,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> and one comes from Donja-Dolina in
Bosnia.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> It seems to occur occasionally in the mountain regions of
Austria and south Germany, though I can find no evidence of its further
extension northwards.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon in the British Isles; seven have been found in the
Thames estuary, four come from the east coast of England, and two from
Scotland; 110 have been found in Ireland, of which forty-two are in
English collections and sixty-eight in the National Museum in Dublin.
The Irish specimens seem, as we have seen, to be of a very early form,
as in some features they closely resemble Type E.</p>

<p>The distribution of this type is somewhat curious, since it occurs
plentifully in the British Isles and especially in Ireland, while it
is rare or non-existent in the intervening regions. Since the British
examples, especially those found in Ireland, appear to be early examples
of the type, we may surmise that they belong to late waves of the
movement which carried Type E over the west.</p>

<p>Type G, the Hallstatt type, is so called because a few specimens were
found in the famous cemetery at this place.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> It would be a mistake,
however, to consider it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> having evolved in that region or dispersed
from that centre. It seems more probable that, like the previous type,
it developed in the mountain zone, and the evidence available at present
suggests for its centre the upper reaches of the Danube, between Ulm
and Sigmaringen;<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> but detailed work on the spot is needed before
this can be determined with accuracy. D√©chelette says that this type
is generally distributed throughout Central Europe,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> and this is
true if we confine that term to the mountain zone, for it does not
occur in Hungary. It is relatively rare in North Germany, two occur
in Schleswig-Holstein,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> a few in Scandinavia,<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> and one in
Finland.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>In France the greater number occur in Burgundy, in the valley of the
Saone and down the Rhone Valley; also in the department of Lot on
the upper waters of the Dordogne and in the departments of Indre and
Cher. Several examples have been found in the Seine valley, in the
neighbourhood of Paris,<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> a point to which I shall have to refer in
a later chapter. In the British Isles nineteen have been found in the
valley of the Thames below and including Reading, and six elsewhere
near the east coast; twenty-four have been recorded from Ireland, of
which twenty are in the National Museum in Dublin. This type is, then,
found distributed fairly generally throughout the mountain zone of the
Celtic cradle, and over many areas in Celtic lands, though it only
occurs sparsely elsewhere. In the Mediterranean region it is entirely
absent.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>I have dealt at some length with these distributions, for there is
no better way of interpreting arch√¶ological evidence and making
it disclose, in broad outline at least, its historical content.
Unfortunately no accurate catalogue of the swords discovered in most
countries is in existence, though owing to the smallness of their
numbers the lists are fairly complete for Italy and Greece. It would
not be a very great undertaking to make an equally complete illustrated
catalogue for the area included in the former empire of Austro-Hungary.
In other regions the numbers are greater,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> and little has been done
to catalogue them. The formation of an illustrated card catalogue of
all the metal objects of the bronze age in the museums and private
collections in the British Isles is in progress, under the auspices
of a research committee appointed by the British Association for the
advancement of Science. The specimens deposited in English collections
have, for the most part, been already included in this catalogue, and
it is from this that the bulk of the statistical matter relating to the
British Isles has been derived.</p>

<p>As we have seen in some earlier chapters, distribution of certain types
of bronze implements may be taken as evidence of trade, and we have
to consider whether it was some form of commerce which carried the
leaf-shaped swords to Ireland, Finland, Podolia and Egypt, or whether
this wide distribution betokens some other form of movement. Before
the days of fairly large ships and highly organised industry it is
not uncommon to find implements, whether of flint or obsidian, copper
or bronze, carried from country to country, without apparently any
general movement of the population. On the other hand, when pottery and
heavier or more easily damaged goods pass from one centre to another,
it usually betokens migration. We have seen how this was so when the
beakers were carried from Bohemia towards Jutland and Britain. Of course
Roman pottery was shipped extensively for trade purposes, as were red
figure vases and other types of Greek ceramic wares. The same is true,
though to a less extent, of Mycenean and some Minoan wares, for the
√Ügean traders exported oil and wine. But such export of pottery betokens
a relatively high civilisation and a well-organised commerce. Under
more primitive conditions we may, I think, postulate that where metal
implements or small cult objects alone were carried, these are evidence
only of trade, while when pottery is found, as it were, on the move,
this indicates a movement of the potters, hence a migration of people.
When pottery and weapons are both found moving together, especially if
the weapons are of a more advanced type than those hitherto found in the
land into which they are being introduced, we may suspect, if indeed
we cannot be sure, that we are dealing with a hostile invasion and the
arrival of conquerors.</p>

</div>

<p>It will be necessary for us, therefore, to determine whether these
swords, which have penetrated nearly the whole of Europe except the
Iberian peninsula, were carried by trade, by some other form of peaceful
penetration, or by conquest. The great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> suddenness with which some
of the types spread, apparently within the space of a few years, for
there is little if any modification of form, from the central region to
places many hundreds of miles distant, precludes the second of these
alternatives, for peaceful penetration by land is a slow process, and
we should expect progressive variation of type the farther we pass
from the centre. It seems, on the face of it, unlikely that a people,
especially a sporting and warlike people like our steppe-folk, would
engage in a trade which would provide their neighbours with a weapon,
superior to all others available, which they had produced for themselves
after generations of experiment; nor is it likely that they would
permit their Alpine subjects to do so, even if the fear of the unknown
and the dislike of adventure had not been sufficient to prevent these
home-loving people from setting out on so adventurous a task, involving,
as it sometimes did, the passage across northern seas. Such a practice,
then, seems at first sight unlikely, but if the other alternative, the
hostile invasion, were true, we should expect to find evidence of the
arrival of fresh people in the presence of new types of pottery and
fresh burial customs.</p>

<p>If we examine the British evidence, we shall find reason to believe
that the leaf-shaped swords arrived with a new culture and a fresh
element in the population. In a recent paper Mr. O. G. S. Crawford has
dealt with this subject, and pointed out that the leaf-shaped bronze
swords of the Hallstatt period, our Type G, arrived with an invasion of
people who came from Central Europe.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Crawford seems to include in
this movement all bronze leaf-shaped swords of whatever type, but the
evidence on which he depends is only applicable to Type G. It will be
well, therefore, for the moment to postpone consideration of the arrival
of the Type E swords.</p>

<div class="figright">
   <a id="fig_19" name="fig_19"></a>

<p class="caption">FIG. 19.&mdash;URN OF TYPE 3.</p>
</div>

<p>Crawford has shown that not only did these swords arrive in considerable
numbers, but with them came a number of other objects, such as razors,
sickles, and other tools, which have been found at various occupied
sites, such as Llyn Fawr, South Lodge Camp, and &ldquo;Old England&rdquo; at
Brentford. Near the last-named site were found some skulls which Sir
Arthur Keith<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> has pronounced to be typical Alpines of the Swiss
lake-dwelling type. Now at most of the sites where this lake-dwelling
culture has been found, there occurs also, as Crawford has shown, a type
of pottery, which he calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> &ldquo;finger-tip ware,&rdquo; that is to say pottery
ornamented with raised ribs of clay and finger-tip impressions. Now such
pottery is found, it is true, in the neolithic age in this country,
but it died out about the time of the arrival of the Beaker-folk, when
cord-ornamented pottery came into fashion. On the other hand in Central
Europe, and especially in the region where the mountain zone blends with
the plain, such pottery remained in use continuously from the neolithic,
through the bronze, to the early iron age.</p>

<p>That such pottery came to this country with a fresh people is clear
from the foregoing evidence, and that they entered armed and by force
is equally clear from the presence of the numerous swords of this date
which have been found. That they came in considerable numbers and came
to stay is also shown from the number of settlements, and from the
later occurrence of this finger-tip ware at such sites as All Cannings
Cross<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> in Wiltshire, where this culture lasted until well after 500
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Some of the best examples of this finger-tip pottery are the urns found
in Wessex, which are called the Deverel-Rimbury type, and which are
dated by Lord Abercromby<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> as lasting from 950 to 650 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>
Crawford, following D√©chelette, brings in his invasion about 800
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, or rather later, and, though we may find grounds for
believing that their arrival may have been earlier it looks as though
the finger-tip pottery of the Deverel-Rimbury type may have been here
before the coming of the people with the Type G Swords. Be that as it
may, we learn from Lord Abercromby that in the south of England several
types of pottery preceded the Deverel-Rimbury type, the one immediately
preceding it being his Type 3, which he believes to have been in use
between 1150 and 950 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, if not earlier.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Many of these,
such as those from Wiltshire, Nos. 373, 374<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> and 379, exhibit the
characteristic ornament of this finger-tip ware. If Lord Abercromby&rsquo;s
chronology is even approximately correct, and it is in these cases
vouched for by a series of excellent synchronisms, the pottery
characteristic of Central Europe had been introduced into the south of
England some centuries before the arrival of the people who introduced
the Type G swords. This leads us to suspect that the Type E swords were
also brought by an invading people, fairly early in the Type E period,
as a certain number of Type D swords have also occurred.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to pursue this argument through other countries, or to
point out that some of our cinerary urns are in shape exactly like the
bronze buckets used in Central Europe at the dawn of the iron age. We
shall have occasion to discuss the special conditions in other countries
in later chapters. Here it will be sufficient to suggest that all the
British evidence tends to show that the spread of these swords was
accompanied by a movement of pottery and other elements of culture, that
at Brentford by the existence of skulls and elsewhere by inference we
may conclude that there was a corresponding movement of people, and that
in the British Isles, at any rate, the presence of this considerable
number of leaf-shaped swords betokens an invasion. There seems to be no
sufficient reason for believing that the circumstances were materially
different in the other regions in which these swords have been found.</p>

<span class="s5">GREEK LANDS AND THE BASIS OF CHRONOLOGY</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smaller">E</span> have seen in the
last chapter that different types of leaf-shaped
swords have been disseminated throughout various quarters of Europe,
and we have found reason for believing that in Celtic lands at least
their appearance signified a hostile invasion. If, as may well be the
case, the same is true of other parts of Europe, we are dealing with
a series of invasions, all starting from somewhere within the Celtic
cradle, and affecting almost every part of the continent. Our purpose
in this work is not so much to record evidence as to interpret it, to
restore the main features of early history rather than to describe
arch√¶ological remains. Now the backbone of history is chronology, and we
cannot interpret our evidence satisfactorily unless we can place it in
its true chronological setting. In discussing the seven types of swords
an endeavour was made to arrange them in an orderly sequence, and thus
to set up a relative chronology. In this chapter a positive system of
dating will be attempted.</p>

<p>It is clear that it is to the south-east that we must first look
for help, for in Greek lands documentary evidence reaches back some
centuries further than it does elsewhere in Europe, and is preceded by
an immense mass of tradition, much of which clearly belongs more to
legend than to myth. These legends, moreover, have received intensive
study, and their contents have been brought into line with arch√¶ological
data.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Further than this we have the two swords found in Egypt,
one of them engraved with a monarch&rsquo;s name, so that a study of these
south-eastern specimens should enable us to obtain one point, at least,
in our system of dates.</p>

<p>Now it has been pointed out by Sir William Ridgeway<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> that certain
people, whom he calls &ldquo;Ach√¶ans,&rdquo; entered Greece from the north, bringing
with them certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> elements of culture, which can best be matched in the
Danube basin. These, according to the traditions preserved in the Iliad,
were the immediate ancestors of the heroes of the Trojan War. Recently
Dr. Wace,<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> who has made a careful study of the pre-Hellenic remains
of the mainland of Greece, especially of the pottery, has pointed out
that there is but one break in the ceramic evolution of that region, the
introduction of geometric ware. This is, he believes, best explained by
equating it with the Dorian invasion, which took place some generations
after the siege of Troy. Dr. Wace has certainly made out a strong case,
and we must accept his view that no invasion, in the strict sense of the
term, preceded that of the Dorians; but while he would have us scrap
the &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; hypothesis in its entirety, we must, I think, consider
awhile before dismissing all the evidence that Sir William Ridgeway has
accumulated.</p>

<p>Much of Ridgeway&rsquo;s arch√¶ological evidence is Hallstatt in type and,
apparently at least, Hallstatt in date, and may well equate better
with the Dorian than the &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; movement, but the legends are not to
be lightly swept aside, and we have the swords, which are admittedly
pre-geometric, and so pre-Dorian, and may well antedate also the Trojan
War. There is also the introduction into southern Greece of a type of
palace, which seems to have developed in a more northerly clime.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
We have, therefore, evidence for some intrusive elements entering Greek
lands from the Danube basin, bringing with them swords of Central
European type, a new type of domestic architecture, and, we may well
believe, certain deities and beliefs of more northern origin,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> yet
the continuity of the ceramic culture shows that there had been no
general displacement of the population.</p>

<p>Before attempting to decide between these conflicting views, it may be
wise to consider the term &ldquo;Ach√¶an.&rdquo; By this I mean only those people,
who are the subject of Sir William Ridgeway&rsquo;s hypothesis, and who
organised the attack upon Priam&rsquo;s Troy. They may, for all we know, be a
people or merely a class, and their connection with the Ach√¶ans of the
Peloponnese, discussed by Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> may be very remote. It seems
clear, in fact, that the term as used by Herodotus connoted something
very different from what the term meant to Homer, and what it signifies
in the pages of Ridgeway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the presence of these leaf-shaped swords in pre-Dorian Greece seems
to postulate the presence of intruders from the Danube basin; the
paucity of their number, all the more striking when we consider the
extent of the excavations carried out in Greek lands, seems to indicate
that these intruders were few. These swords had been, as we have seen,
invented by the Nordic steppe-folk in Central Europe, and may sometimes
have been used by their Alpine subjects. But for a few strangers to
intrude into a foreign land needs on their part considerable courage and
the spirit of adventure, features which we have found characteristic of
the Nordic steppe-folk, and conspicuously lacking among the Alpines. We
may, therefore, take it for granted that these intruders, who introduced
the leaf-shaped swords into Greek lands, were of Nordic type and
temperament.</p>

<p>The heroes of the Trojan War, as Ridgeway has pointed out, were
newcomers to the land.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> In most cases their grandfathers are
mentioned, seldom a great-grandfather, unless it is to state that he
was a god. Sometimes even the grandfather was a deity, as in the case
of Polypoites, but usually when this is so we have reason for believing
that the hero, like Nestor, the grandson of Poseidon, was an old man.
The earliest ancestor was sometimes Zeus, but usually the pedigree is
not actually traced to the divine forefather. In a large number of
cases, especially of the minor heroes, they are said to be of the stock
of Ares. Dr. Hall has suggested that Ares and his mistress Hera were the
chief deities of these northern invaders.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>We hear very little in the Iliad of these first human ancestors of the
&ldquo;Ach√¶ans,&rdquo; nor has later Greek legend much more to say about most of
them. We have, however, various stories of heroes, arriving alone like
Theseus, Perseus, Herakles, and Peleus, or perhaps accompanied by one
friend like Amphitryon, at some Greek city. The hero is well received
by the king of the city, and often relieves him of some difficulty,
whether it be the repulse of a hostile attack, as in the case of Theseus
and the Pallantids, or Amphitryon and the Teleb&#339;ans, the punishment
of robbers, such as Periphates, Sinis, Sciron, Cercyon or Damastes, or
the slaying of wild beasts like the Cromyon sow, the Marathon bull,
the Cadmeian fox, or the various monsters slain by Herakles. The king
honours the visitor, the princess, like Ariadne, Com&#339;tho or Polymela,
falls in love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> with him, then some unfortunate accident occurs, as was
the case with √Ügeus, Acrisius, and Eurytion, and the king is slain. The
hero then ascends the throne, marries the princess, and, as the fairy
tales say, they lived happily ever after. Such is the almost universal
burden of Greek legend, as it is of the <em>m√§rchen</em>, which grew up in the
northern forests.</p>

<p>It has been usual to interpret the stories of these heroes as referring
to invading peoples, and to believe that the name of the chief only
has survived, whereas the memory of the people has perished. That such
was often the case is likely, but when dealing with the first &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo;
intruders we must guard ourselves against taking this for granted.
Dr. Wace&rsquo;s arguments are all against the arrival of a fresh people at
this time, for there is no introduction of new styles of pottery; on
the other hand, there is nothing in his evidence antagonistic to the
view that a few northern heroes, coming unaccompanied by men-at-arms,
succeeded in making themselves masters of the cities of pre-Hellenic
Greece. It is possible that in this case, as in many others, nineteenth
century scholarship has been too clever and too critical, and that the
legends as they have come down to us are nearer to the truth than the
amendments which have been suggested.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>We shall be able to judge better if we look at the actions of Nordics
in later times. At the downfall of the Roman empire it was not unusual
for quite small bands of Nordics to become masters of even large
territories; some of the Norsemen made themselves, single-handed, kings
of the cities in South Russia. Later Rollo, with but a handful of men,
became Duke of Normandy and defied the power of the Carolingian monarch;
later still small groups of Normans conquered Sicily, and set up their
rule in many places in the Mediterranean region. Lastly, how often have
Englishmen, sometimes quite alone, gained great influence in large
communities of aliens, and been in a position to make themselves kings
had they not preferred to annex the community to the British Empire?
Thus has much of the Empire been built up. But by far the best parallel
is the case of the first Rajah of Sarawak.</p>

<p>When such events have taken place in historical times, even in our own
day, we cannot consider it as impossible that wandering Nordic heroes
from the Danube basin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> accompanied perhaps by a faithful henchman,
should have found it possible to establish themselves as kings over the
trading cities of Mycenean Greece.</p>

<p>But let us glance for a moment at these trading cities and their
inhabitants. The original people of the Greek mainland, like the bulk
of the present population, seem to have been of that eastern Alpine or
Dinaric type, scarcely distinguishable from the bulk of the population
of Asia Minor. These are tall dark people, with small but broad heads,
which are very high and somewhat conical at the top, though sometimes
the excessively flattened occiput gives the impression that the head has
been sliced from the top of the forehead to the back of the neck. As
far as one can judge from the available evidence, these were the only
inhabitants of the bulk of the peninsula, until coastal settlements were
made by the Cretans, some in the second Middle Minoan period, but most
of them at the beginning of the Late Minoan.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>The original inhabitants of Crete seem to have been typical members of
the Mediterranean race, but during Early Minoan times we find a few
broad-headed people arriving in the east of the island, and gradually
spreading over the eastern half.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> It has been taken for granted,
quite naturally, that this broad-headed infusion came from Asia Minor,
the population of which at that time must have been exclusively
broad-headed. But about the time that these broad-heads appear in Crete
we find evidence in the island of the development of the copper mines
at Gournia,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> and of the accumulation of gold ornaments, such as the
treasure of Mochlos.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> There are also signs of the existence of an
oversea commerce and of a trade in olive oil with Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>This leads us to wonder whether these broad-heads belonged to wanderers
from Anatolia, or whether it is not more probable that here we have
evidence of the arrival of the Prospectors, who seem always to be the
organisers of oversea trade and of mining operations. We must remember
too, that by 2800 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, not long after the beginning of the
Early Minoan period, the Sumerians were trading in the Mediterranean,
and knew, if they had not already settled in, Crete.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>These are details of which we cannot speak with certainty at present,
but all the isolated data available are best explained by believing
that the great activities of the trade in the √Ügean and especially in
Crete were organised by and were in the hands of Prospectors, who had
come originally, though not necessarily directly, from the Persian
Gulf, and who were employing the Mediterranean aborigines as mariners,
miners and craftsmen. When in Middle and Late Minoan times these Cretans
made settlements on the mainland, in the Argolid, in B&#339;otia, and at
Pylos, settlements which are recorded in the legends of Danaus, Cadmus
and Neleus, we can well believe that, while some of their subjects were
of the Mediterranean race, and others, perhaps, drawn from the Alpine
aborigines of the mainland, the rulers were in all cases Prospectors.</p>

<p>Professor Ure<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> has recently shown us that in Greek lands, as well as
in renaissance Italy, we find two types of rulers, who may be described
as Kings and Tyrants. The king is a military chief, of aristocratic
bearing and origin, and one more often interested in the territory than
in the city. The tyrant, on the other hand, is essentially a merchant
or a business man, his outlook bourgeois, and he rules over a city and
its trading connections, rather than over a wide expanse of land. In
Greece, Ure believes, the introduction of metal currency caused the
earlier kings to be replaced by these tyrants or merchant princes. He
has supported his thesis by a vast mass of evidence, which we need not
repeat here, but in his conclusions I think we may see the supplanting
of the Nordic lord by the Prospector, as times became more settled and
trade, rather than fighting, became the more important occupation.</p>

<p>Many of Ure&rsquo;s arguments would apply equally to the Minoan age, when
piracy had been put down and oversea trade was booming. The rise of
the Greek tyrants was due, he thinks, to the rise of a coinage, just
as the modern plutocrat has risen to power on the development of paper
currency; the Minoan tyrant, comes to the front as metal, an easily
portable and exchangeable commodity, succeeds flint or obsidian. It was
into these trading cities, each governed by a Prospector tyrant, that
I believe these Nordic &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; adventurers to have arrived from the
Danube basin with their leaf-shaped swords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>Now there are two classes of men, both of them wielding large powers
over others, whose characters have been sharply contrasted by many
writers. The kingly type is found in noblemen, at any rate of the old
school, medi√¶val knights, landed proprietors and officers of the army
and navy; the same traditions hold good in the upper ranks, at least,
of the civil service and among the professional classes. The relations
between these lords and the people committed to their charge, whether
subjects, tenants or employ√©s, are usually good, and friction rarely
arises unless the subject class is of an alien race. These kings or
lords have usually been able to retain for generations the respect of
their subjects, often to inspire very great love and devotion.</p>

<p>On the other hand the leader, whose claim to his position rests only
upon wealth or the power to create wealth, is often even extravagantly
generous, and has usually ingratiating manners, which are in sharp
distinction from the <em>hauteur</em> which is more characteristic of the lord;
yet he rarely makes himself loved or even liked by those dependent
on him, even though his actions be kind and his judgments just. This
contrast has furnished a theme to many writers, and has been ably
summarised by Ure,<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> who quotes in support pregnant passages from the
works of H. G. Wells<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> and William James.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Such differences, Ure
thinks, distinguished the king from the tyrant, and the same contrast, I
would suggest, held good between the &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; heroes and the rulers of
the Minoan cities.</p>

<p>We have seen reason for believing that the population of the Minoan
cities of Greece consisted of Mediterraneans and perhaps some few
Alpines, under the rule of a Prospector tyrant. The latter&rsquo;s rule was
possibly just, he made money for his city, but most of all for himself,
and, in spite of occasional fits of lavish generosity, he would not
have been popular. He was engaged in exploiting the proletariat, and
they were fully conscious of the fact. Though his manner was outwardly
ingratiating, he was distrusted by his subjects, who felt that they were
but pawns in his game. Thus the sword swayed over his head as over that
of Damocles, held only by a slender thread; revolutions or rumours of
revolutions were of constant occurrence, and the tyrant, intent on money
making, had little leisure or inclination, even if he had the capacity,
for maintaining order or of inspiring loyalty in the hearts of his
subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>We can well imagine that the arrival in such a community of one or two
northern barbarians, rough and rude, but strong and honest, would have
been like a breath of fresh air entering a stuffy room. The tyrant
would have welcomed a man who could put down highwaymen or lead his
mercenaries to battle. He would, perhaps, have made him chief of his
police or generalissimo of the town forces, and, as the hero restored
law and order and kept the populace quiet, he would have promised him
much reward, including perhaps his daughter&rsquo;s hand. All would have gone
well until the tyrant, with the instinct of the Prospector to make a
bargain and to get something for nothing, endeavoured, like Laomedon of
Troy, to cheat his Nordic ally or to offer him a base substitute for
promises made.</p>

<p>The Nordic, as incapable of understanding such double-dealing as of thus
acting himself, would quite naturally have been incensed. We can picture
him accusing the tyrant of dishonesty and ejecting him from his palace,
when he would have fallen a speedy victim to the anger of his subjects.
The hero would have placed himself upon the vacant throne with the help
and goodwill of the people, who had admired his strength, courage and
fair dealing. Lastly, he would, perhaps, have married the daughter of
his predecessor, not so much from romantic motives as to establish more
completely his right to the throne, for, despite what has been written
to the contrary, some form of matrilinear succession seems to have
obtained in Minoan Greece.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>The Greek legends referring to the early heroes are full of such
details, and the above imaginary sketch may be taken as a composite
picture of the kind of events which took place, in all probability, in
many a city of pre-Hellenic Greece, as the leaf-shaped swords first made
their appearance.</p>

<p>We have, hitherto, taken it for granted that these &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; intruders
were Nordic, and our reasons have been mainly the presence of the
swords, the northern character of their palaces and the fact that such
enterprises are in keeping with the subsequent behaviour of Nordic
adventurers. But the identification, perhaps, requires further proof.
The Nordics as we know were tall, fair and long-headed; how does this
agree with what we know of the &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; heroes and their forbears?</p>

<p>The whole tenour of the legends, attributing to them deeds requiring
strength and endurance, certainly suggests that the heroes were
considered in later days to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> been above the average in stature.
That they were fair-haired has been taken for granted by many
writers.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> It has been suggested, however, that the fact that
Menelaus was called fair, signifies that he was in this respect an
exception to the rule, and that the others were as dark as the majority
of modern Greeks. Moreover, it has been pointed out that &#958;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#8000;&#962;
may only mean brown, and that Menelaus had brown hair.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>The first argument certainly carries some weight, and does seem to
imply that there was something exceptional in Menelaus&rsquo; fair hair.
But the Atreid√¶, according to fifth century legend, were Pelopids,
and this is hinted, though not expressly stated, in the Iliad. Now
other legends bring Pelops from Phrygia, though, of course, this may
only signify that he was a Phrygian, who left the Briges before their
departure for Asia. But the Pelopid√¶, in their customs, differed from
the other &ldquo;Ach√¶ans.&rdquo; Later legend attributes to them a type of endogamy,
interpreted afterwards as incest, infant sacrifice, and cannibalistic
habits. √Üschylus<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> looks upon these customs as crimes, and attributes
them to a curse upon the House of Tantalus. I think, however, we may
see in the Pelopids, and perhaps in other groups of <em>op</em> peoples, some
non-Nordic type, most probably Alpines of some kind, who had accompanied
the &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; heroes southwards. That one of these should be fair-haired
would be unusual, though by no means impossible if he had had a Nordic
ancestress. If &#958;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#8000;&#962; ever meant brown it must have meant
light brown or auburn, and its force would be equally as great as if it
meant flaxen; the Mediterraneans and eastern Alpines never have light
brown hair; it is not uncommon among Nordics.</p>

<p>Lastly we may take the case of the Thracians, who, as we have seen,
were almost certainly the stock from which the &ldquo;Ach√¶ans&rdquo; were derived.
According to Ridgeway<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> some of these were fair and some dark, that
is to say a fair Nordic strain had entered a land peopled with dark
Alpines, and the result was a red-haired strain (&#960;&#965;&#961;&#961;&#8000;&#962;), as is
often the case when fair and dark strains have mixed.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>We have no right to expect from Homer, or any other Greek writer, an
account of the head-form of the &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; heroes. Nevertheless we find
in the Iliad a word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> which gives us some indication on this point.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>
It is noticeable that all the people mentioned by name are captains of
hosts, or members of the nobility; the Iliad only records the doings
of the &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; heroes. One exception only is there to this rule. At
one moment the host, composed no doubt of Alpines and Mediterraneans,
thinks of revolting. Their leader is a mob-orator, fond of arguing
as is the way with Alpines, and we can have little doubt as to the
racial affinities of Thersites. If we had any, one epithet used of
him would satisfy us, for his head is described as &#966;&#959;&#958;&#8000;&#962;.
The exact meaning of this term has been a matter of dispute, but it
is usually rendered &ldquo;tapering to a point,&rdquo; and the expression
&#966;&#959;&#958;&#8001;&#962; &#7956;&#951;&#957; &#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#7968;&#957; means that he &ldquo;had a sugar-loaf head.&rdquo; What better
description could we have of the ordinary head-form of the eastern
Alpine inhabitants of the Balkan peninsula and Anatolia? If this had
been the usual type of head of the &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; heroes, the epithet would
not have been used as distinctive of the rebellious soldier; it can only
have been so used to imply how different he was in this respect from the
noble &ldquo;Ach√¶an.&rdquo; This seems to me to indicate, exceptionally clearly,
that the Homeric heroes were long-headed.</p>

<p>Thus the heroes are found to be tall, fair and long-headed, and so
possessing the three chief physical characteristics of the Nordic race.
The resemblances between their mental characters and those of the
Vikings have often been noted before and need not be repeated.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>It will be remembered that I have suggested that the Nordic &ldquo;Ach√¶ans&rdquo;
were an offshoot of the body, who as Thracians and Phrygians moved
eastward into Thrace and Asia Minor. I have also suggested that they
came to the south down the Vardar valley. Usually they have been brought
straight from Thrace, which is, of course, possible, but Ridgeway, on
the other hand, brings them from Epirus, and points out that they held
in veneration the Zeus of Dodona.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> If their arrival was, as I have
suggested, in small bands or by ones and twos, there is no reason to
postulate that they all arrived by the same route; all that matters
is that they should have come eventually from the Danube basin. As I
have already mentioned, some of the Homeric heroes were Zeus-born,
and may have come <em>via</em> Epirus, while others, the majority, were of
the stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> of Ares. Now Ares was the god of the Thracians, or of some
group of people inhabiting Thrace.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> It would seem then that some,
probably most, of the &ldquo;Ach√¶ans&rdquo; came from the Thraco-Phrygian stock,
though whether they started on their way from Thrace, or left the main
body before it had reached that country, is a matter of relatively
small importance. When the arch√¶ology of Macedonia and Thrace is better
understood, we shall doubtless be able to clear up this point.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately not possible to date these swords with precision
from their associations, as there are difficulties in ascertaining the
exact position in which they were found, or in identifying the potsherds
and other objects found with them. They are believed to date from the
third Late Minoan period, that is to say, sometime after 1400 or 1350
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span> It is here that our Egyptian evidence helps us.</p>

<p>We learn from the Egyptian records that<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> in the fifth year of
Merneptah, 1220 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, the Delta was attacked by Meryey, king
of the Libyans, who brought with him a host of Tehenu, who had been
living in the country behind Alexandria. He had also numerous oversea
allies, pirates and traders, who came in search of loot. These were
the Sherden, Shekelesh, Teresh and the Ekwesh. If the three first
have been rightly identified, they were the people of Sardinia and
Sicily and the Tyrsenians, who we know later as the Etruscans; whether
these identifications are correct has been much disputed, but it is
significant that all three represent areas or peoples which we have
already identified with Prospector activities. On the fourth the Ekwesh,
there is more general agreement, and I believe all authorities unite
in seeing in this name the word &ldquo;Ach√¶an.&rdquo; If this be so, our Nordic
intruders, who had made themselves lords of the trading cities in
Greece, had taken to the sea, like their fellows in the Baltic, and
were, with Prospector allies, attacking and plundering the rich lands of
the Delta.</p>

<p>It is to this expedition that I attribute the two swords already
described, as indeed was suggested some years ago by Professor
Peet.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> One is unquestionably of Type D, the type which has been
most commonly found in Greek lands, while the other seems, as far as
can be judged from its damaged hilt, to be also of the same type. The
latter is engraved with the name of Seti II., who reigned from 1209 to
1205 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> so cannot be later than the latter date. It is
probable that it was a <em>souvenir</em> of the raid of 1220 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>,
upon which Seti placed his name some ten to fifteen years later.</p>

<p>Thus Type D was in use in 1220 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and must have developed
earlier, for we must allow some years to have elapsed since the
&ldquo;Ach√¶ans&rdquo; left the Danube basin for Greek lands, a few more before many
of them had established themselves as kings, and a further interval
before they can have organised a piratical expedition on a sufficiently
extensive scale to threaten the safety of Egypt. Fifteen years would be
the shortest possible time for such a succession of events, thirty years
more likely. So we may consider that some of these intruders left the
Danube basin about 1250 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> Now it must have been about this
time, or rather earlier, that the Briges, from the north of Macedonia,
crossed the Hellespont into Asia Minor, where they became known as
Phrygians. This movement appears to have been one of a succession of
similar raids, which carried the Thraco-Phrygian people from the Danube
basin eastwards. It seems probable that our &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; intruders were
part of this body, who, instead of moving on to the east, had passed
southwards in search of adventure.</p>

<p>Type G, as we have seen, has been found at the famous cemetery at
Hallstatt, in some of the older graves. This cemetery is believed to
date, at the earliest, from 900 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, but iron was found in
most of the graves, and the bronze swords were few in number, and from
graves in which no iron was found. We may safely conclude that these
swords belong to the very beginning of this period, and had been in use
for some time previously.</p>

<p>It is always a difficult matter to determine how long a given type of
implement or weapon remained in use. Besides this we must allow for
overlapping, that is to say for the period during which a type still
survived in use after its successor, which was doubtless in many ways
its superior, had been designed. I am inclined to believe that about
twenty-five years is sufficient to allow for this overlap, though
possibly on rare occasions an obsolete weapon may have been preserved
longer, especially as a trophy or memento.</p>

<p>If we allow a period of one hundred years between the introduction of
one type and the first use of its successor, we shall be able to fit the
two ascertained dates, and this period seems on the whole reasonable.
Types A and B are, however, scarce in Central Europe, though Type B
seems, in a modified form, to have persisted longer in the Baltic
region. I propose, therefore, to reduce the hundred years to fifty in
each of these cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p class="bottom1">Such a chronological scheme is, of necessity, provisional, and must be
susceptible of modification as further synchronisms are worked out, but
on the evidence at present available, I am inclined to think that it is
not far from the truth, and that any amendments which may have to be
made in the future will scarcely exceed fifty years either way. This
scheme is for Central Europe only, and may be true also for Italy and
Greece. Various modifications may, however, have to be made in applying
it to more distant regions, especially in the north and west, such as
Brittany, the British Isles and the Scandinavian countries.</p>

C<span class="smaller">HAPTER</span> X<br />

<span class="s5">THE IRON SWORD</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smaller">E</span> have seen that every
type of sword, from Type A to Type E, has been
found in the Hungarian plain, though Type B is not common there. On the
other hand, Types F and G are entirely absent. It is unreasonable to
suppose that, while the people of the mountain zone were developing more
useful types of swords, the men of the plain were continuing for some
centuries to use swords of Type E. Even were this the case we should
expect to find that the swords of this type were vastly more numerous
than those previously in use. But we have seen that only ten have been
recorded for Hungary, whereas we have nineteen of Type D. There remain
only two possibilities: either the people left the plain uninhabited, or
they had found some weapon more useful than the bronze sword.</p>

<p>It is true, as we have seen, that steppe-lands may be deserted in times
of excessive drought, and there is some reason for believing that such
a dry period occurred somewhere about this time, for it was in 1350 or
1300 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> that we must place the Aramean invasion from the
Arabian steppe, which was such a serious menace to Shalmaneser I.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
But this drought, even could we be sure that it affected a small upland
steppe like that of Hungary, occurred somewhat too early for our
purpose. There is also the alternative theory that too heavy a rainfall
in the mountain regions might have made life unpleasant.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> But this
would have left a more marked effect upon the mountain zone than on the
plain. There may, indeed, have been an exodus, in fact, we shall find
reason for believing that this was so, but it is unlikely that the rich
Hungarian plain was left long uninhabited. There remains the alternative
explanation, the discovery of a new weapon, and I hope to give reasons
for believing that this is the true solution, and that the new weapon
was the iron sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Some years ago M. Chantre investigated a large series of tombs in the
basin of the Koban, just north of the Caucasus mountains. Here he found
a culture, closely resembling in many details the remains found in
the cemetery at Hallstatt. The earlier weapons were of bronze, but in
most cases the swords, while retaining hilts of that metal, had blades
of iron or steel.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> It has been much disputed which of these two
cemeteries, Hallstatt and the Koban, is the earlier, but I hope to show
that the Koban graves must antedate those in Austria.</p>

<p>M. Chantre extended his investigations to the other side of the
mountains, and on the southern slope of the Caucasus found evidence of
the culture of a humble, mountain folk, with rude pots, but, what is
important for our purpose, he found in these graves spear-heads and
small objects of iron.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>Now Professor Gowland has told us that &ldquo;In Western Asia there are two
important districts where iron ores are of very extensive occurrence,
and in which remains of early iron manufacture are found.&rdquo; He adds,
&ldquo;from a metallurgical point of view, deduced from the extent and
character of the ancient remains, there are strong reasons for believing
that the first-mentioned region was the first in which the metal was
regularly produced.&rdquo; This first-mentioned region he describes as &ldquo;on the
south-east of the Euxine (ancient Paphlagonia and Pontus) extending from
the modern Yeshil Irmak to Batum, and comprising a series of mountain
ranges, not far from the coast, along the lower slopes and foot hills of
which the iron deposits are scattered.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> The graves with the iron
spear-heads described by Chantre are just at the north-eastern end of

were renowned workers in iron in the sixth century.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>Chantre has shown that the two cultures which he described were existing
at the same time, for the graves of one people sometimes contained
objects belonging to the culture of the other;<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> not only, then, did
the cultures synchronise, but the peoples had come into contact. There
is no reason for believing that the Koban folk, militarist though they
were, had conquered their humble neighbours. That the reverse had taken
place is unthinkable. The evidence suggests that the contact had been
peaceful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> that trade relations had been established, and perhaps the
Koban folk, who appear to have been new-comers in this region, may have
taken wives from their neighbours. All this points to the fact that it
was in the Koban region that the steppe-folk first learned the use of
iron, and that they carried the knowledge of it thence to the Danube
basin, rather than that the reverse process took place.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, how can we be sure that our Koban people are the
steppe-folk, who have been the heroes of the last few chapters? Their
culture closely resembles that of Hallstatt, which is but a development
of the later bronze age culture of Central Europe, and even their
earlier graves clearly belong to the same series. This is so obvious
that Rostovtzeff is content merely to state that they had come from the
west.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>It may be well, however, to submit more precise proofs of this origin.
During the later bronze age a certain type of pin had been used in
Hungary, possibly, as some think, as a hair-pin, but used more probably,
as Lissauer has suggested, to fasten the <em>chlamys</em>, <em>toga</em> or plaid,
which these steppe-folk appear to have worn. These pins are known
to the Germans as <em>Rudernadln</em><a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> and to the French as <em>√©pingles
√† raquette</em>.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Lissauer recognises five types, which we will
distinguish by the letter A to E. A developes into B, and this again
into alternative forms, C and E. A also developes by stages, which are
at present missing, into D.</p>

<p>Now Types A and B have been found in North Italy, Switzerland,
Wurtemberg and on the Rhine. They have also been found in Hungary, at
T√∂k√©s, Gata, Versecz and Butta. Two have been found in Bohemia, at
Noutonic and Krendorf, and one at Gaya in Moravia. Thus these two types
are fairly well distributed over both halves of the Celtic cradle.
Type D has been found at Andrasfalva in Hungary, and at Alt-Bydzow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> in
Bohemia. Besides these several have been found further afield, one at
Dexheim in Rhenish Hesse, one at Greisheim in Hesse-Darmstadt and one
at Fritzen in East Prussia. Lastly several have been found in the Koban
graves,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and these are larger and more developed than the others.</p>

<p>This evidence seems to show us that this type of pin was at first well
distributed throughout the Celtic cradle, and that the dimensions
of the head increased in Hungary and Bohemia. About the time that
this later form was in use some kind of exodus took place to various
distant places. That one of these expeditions passed to the east, in
the direction of south Russia, is clear from the occurrence of this
type, in its most developed form, in the Koban graveyards. We can well
believe that these emigrants left the Celtic cradle by the Moravian
gate, and passed along the more or less open spaces at the northern foot
of the Carpathians, to which reference has already been made, and so
into the plain of Russia and finally to the foot of the Caucasus. The
journey would have been made on horseback, and need not have occupied
many weeks so there is no need to expect much evidence from objects
lost <em>en route</em>; but, as they must have crossed Podolia on their way
to the Koban, it seems probable that it was these emigrants who left
at Zavadyntse the sword which was mentioned in a previous chapter, as
this is the only example of a Central European sword recorded from the
eastern plain. The Podolian sword was of Type E, and this gives us a
clue to the date, and will enable us to put together in their proper
order these various items of evidence.</p>

SWORD FROM<br />
ZAVADYNTSE.</p>
</div>

<p>The evidence which I have cited in the foregoing pages can best be
explained by believing that about 1150 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> some of the
steppe-folk from the Hungarian plain departed, probably through the
Moravian gate, to seek fresh pastures. While some may have gone
northwards, the majority passed along the open sandy heaths of Galicia,
across Podolia, where a sword was lost at Zavadyntse, and so on to the
grassy plains by the banks of the Koban river. Here they settled for
a time, and during their wanderings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> some came into contact with the
humble iron-using people on the southern slopes of the Caucasus. Whether
they approached these people to trade or to acquire some commodity in
which they themselves were lacking, or whether they sought them to
obtain their daughters for wives, we know not; all we can be sure is
that some intercourse took place. It seems clear, too, that it was from
their humble neighbours that the Koban-folk learned of the existence of
iron or steel, and how to work that metal. It was not small knives they
needed, but better blades for their trusty swords. Thus, I believe, the
use of iron was first learned by the peoples of Europe.</p>

<p>This discovery must have been made by 1100 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> at the latest
probably some years earlier. The Koban-folk realised that steel blades
were far superior to those of bronze, and doubtless were anxious to show
off their new acquisition before the old folks at home. They may, too,
have remembered that the stone from which their neighbours extracted
the metal was plentiful in some parts of the old country. Whatever the
cause, I believe that some of them returned to Hungary with their new
discovery, before bronze swords of Type F had been evolved or at any
rate had come into general use.</p>

<p>Iron ore, which could easily be worked by primitive methods, occurs in
Transylvania, at Gyalar,<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> and it seems likely that it was in this
neighbourhood that they first settled. It is also possible that about
this time some of them occupied Thrace, for in early days Thracian
swords had a great reputation.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> By degrees they pushed up the
Danube, at any rate as far as its junction with the Save. Before 1000
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span> a large number of them advanced up the Morava and down the
Vardar and soon afterwards entered Thessaly, whence they started on that
series of conquests known as the return of the Heraclids, or the Dorian
invasion of Greece.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>Many of these Koban-folk settled on the southern bank of the Danube and
the Save, and in the hill country behind; various cemeteries of this
time have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> discovered in this region, the most famous of which
is that at Glasinatz in Bosnia.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Others pushed up the Save, which
runs through mountains of an easily worked iron ore; evidence of early
workings have been found on the banks of the Mur in Styria and on the
upper Drave in Carinthia.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>A little later, between 1000 and 900 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, some of these people
passed over into Italy. They may have crossed the Adriatic, as did in
all probability the men of the leaf-shaped sword, but it is tempting
to think that they crossed the Predil pass and settled at Santa Lucia
Tolmino, near the head waters of the Isonzo. Here a cemetery was found
in 1885,<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> much of the grave furniture from which is, or was in 1914
in the Trieste Museum, while the remainder is in Vienna. More than 1000
graves were found and the cemetery must have been in existence for
several centuries; but it is usually believed that the earliest graves
date only from the eighth century. Others of the same party crossed the
mountains into the rich Friuli plain and settled at Dernazacco, near
Cividale,<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> and gradually spread thence over the Veneto.</p>

<p>We come across further evidence of their advance at Este,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> and
as they crossed the Po valley they destroyed the <em>terremare</em>, which
had existed there since early in the bronze age and dispersed their
inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> There is evidence that about this time some of the
<em>terramara</em>-folk arrived in Etruria,<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> others are found settling in
the neighbourhood of Taranto,<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> while Dr. Hooton has shown that there
are strong reasons for believing that the earliest settlement on the
Palatine Hill at Rome was due to these people.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> The invaders seem
to have occupied all the plain of Italy north-east of the Apeninnes,
the area known later as Ombrice<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> or Etruria Circumpadana,<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> but
the most important spots at which their remains have been found are
in and around Bologna. From one of the best-known sites in that city
their culture has been called that of Villanova.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> That at one time
they conquered Etruria has been suggested in chapter <a href="#Chapter_IV">
<span class="smaller">IV.</span></a>, and
doubtless it was they who extended the Etruscan rule from the Alps to
the south of Naples; but, as has already been explained, it would be a
mistake to confuse them with the real Etruscans.</p>

<p>We have seen that in the mountain zone the pile-dwelling civilisation
continued throughout the bronze age. This type of culture, introduced
by the early Alpines from Asia Minor, was adopted in Central Europe by
the Nordic intruders, who had made themselves lords over the Alpine
peasants. That they were still retaining their race exclusiveness is
clear from the fact that long and broad-headed skulls are still found
side by side.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> In the plain, however, where we have no evidence of
Alpine settlement, all signs of pile-dwellings are absent.</p>

<p>It is a striking fact that with the arrival of iron swords into the
mountain zone this pile-dwelling culture, which had existed from early
neolithic days till the close of the bronze age, came suddenly to an
end. This cannot be merely an accident, for the same thing occurred all
over Central Europe.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> It is also significant that some centuries
later it was revived.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> Some important revolution must have taken
place to end so abruptly a custom which had lasted for thousands of
years, and to end it with equal suddenness in all parts of the mountain
zone. I can only account for it in one way, by supposing that the men
of the plain, who had never occupied this type of dwelling, had swept
over the mountain zone, carrying fire and the iron sword throughout the
villages of their neighbours.</p>

<p>This I am inclined to think must have been the case, and such an
invasion would account for the widespread exodus of people with the Type
G swords, which we have found scattered over many areas in France, over
parts of North Germany, and stretching even to Scandinavia and Finland,
and which reached the British Isles, with much other culture belonging
to the Swiss lake-dwellings, as Crawford has recently shown us.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>
These people with the Type G swords must have been refugees from the
invasion of the iron sword people. D√©chelette has given us a map showing
their progress in France, and on the same map he indicates the progress
of the iron sword men.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> The latter followed the refugees in almost
every direction, and it was only in the Seine valley that the exiles
escaped pursuit. This is a point to which I shall have to refer in a
later chapter.</p>

<span class="s5">A RECAPITULATION</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smaller">E</span> are now in a
position to interpret the meaning of the evolution and
distribution of these leaf-shaped swords, though there are many details,
which we would gladly know, but of which we must remain in ignorance,
perhaps for ever. We can, however, form some general idea of the events
which were taking place in Europe during the centuries under review, and
it will, perhaps, make for lucidity if they are here recapitulated as a
continuous story.</p>

<p>Since 4000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> some Alpine people, coming originally from Asia
Minor, had occupied the mountain zone, where they had erected their
pile-dwellings and had cultivated their strips of cornlands. Meanwhile
on the Russian steppes, east of the Dnieper, Nordic steppe-folk mounted
on horses, were driving cattle from one pasture to another, sometimes
dwelling in the open steppe, at others pasturing their beasts in the
park-lands and woods to the north. Between these two peoples were the
Tripolje-folk, living in pit-dwellings, cultivating the soil, and later
on importing copper axes from √Ügean traders.</p>

<p>About 3000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, or perhaps rather earlier, a drought caused
some of the steppe-folk to emigrate. It was perhaps at this time, though
probably later, that some passed through the woodland to the middle
Volga valley, where, mixing with communities of Mongoloid fishers,
they developed the Fationovo culture and became ancestors of the red
Finns.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Others in small numbers certainly advanced towards the
Baltic, and passing along its southern shore, appeared later at Furfooz,
in Belgium.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> The majority of these moved slowly up the Rhine valley,
whence some entered Switzerland from the north, and made themselves
lords of the lake-dwelling villages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> Other steppe-folk seem also to
have entered Hungary, probably through the Moravian gate, and settled on
the plain and the eastern foothills of the mountain zone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the knowledge of copper had been introduced by traders, who
had sailed up the Adriatic, and travelled inland from Fiume. This copper
culture reached the Swiss lake-dwellings, and eventually passed down the
Rhone as far as Lyons. It was followed by a bronze culture, which was
imported from Italy and the western Mediterranean.</p>

<p>About 2250 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> another drought caused a dispersal of the
steppe-folk on a greater scale. Some went east, into the remotest
fastnesses of Turkestan, some perhaps as far as the head waters of the
Yenesei and the region around Minutsinsk, while others passed on to the
Iranian plateau. This last group we hear of about 2100 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> as
Kassites, and a few centuries later they conquered Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>Those who went westward seem to have destroyed the Tripolje culture and
driven off its people, unless, indeed, they had already been driven away
by the drought. The bands of steppe-folk divided, some passing north of
the Carpathians and some going south by the shores of the Euxine. This
last group crossed the Danube, and skirting the Balkan mountains arrived
at the east end of Thrace. Here they divided, one band passing to the
west by the shores of the √Ügean and then southwards to Thessaly, where
they frightened the inhabitants, who termed them Centaurs. The other
band crossed the Hellespont, destroyed Hissarlik II., and passed on
into the Anatolian plain, where in due course they organised the native
Alpine population into the Hittite empire.</p>

<p>It is not so easy to follow the group which passed north of the
Carpathians, but they seem to have followed the line of sandy heaths
across Galicia into Silesia, then some, probably, entered Hungary
through the Moravian gate, while others pushed into Bohemia. These last
found there people who were either refugees from the Tripolje area or
folk closely allied to them. These people, who had been accustomed
to a type of cord vase, had found in Bohemia bell-beakers, which had
arrived there via Italy from Spain. From a combination of both types of
ware they had evolved the northern beaker. When the Nordic steppe-folk
arrived from Silesia these Beaker-folk left, and passed northwards
between the Rhine and the Weser, some going to Jutland and some to
Holland. A few of the latter found a refuge in Great Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>In Central Europe, in the district we have called the Celtic cradle, we
find two cultures growing up, one consisting of Alpine peasants under
Nordic lords, which prevailed in the mountain zone; the other, more
truly Nordic, and still pastoral and perhaps nomadic, was limited to the
Hungarian plain. After a short interval of interruption, trading was
resumed with their Italian neighbours by way of Fiume.</p>

<p>It is about this time that the Nordic steppe-folk of Hungary demanded
larger and larger daggers, until at length the earliest leaf-shaped
sword was evolved about 1500 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> During the following years a
few adventurers passed into the Friuli and the Venetian lands, perhaps
to trade, or perhaps to settle. Others, few in number, seem to have
visited the amber coast of the Baltic, and one, at least, died there and
was buried in Schleswig-Holstein. About 1450 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> Type B was
evolved and spread over the mountain zone. It was carried by traders or
invaders towards the Baltic, especially to Denmark. Since this type is
found in considerable numbers in the north, and there continued its own
local development for many years, we must admit that these swords were
not taken there by mere adventurers, but by invaders, few in number,
perhaps, who had gone north to Denmark, and perhaps further still, and
settled, perhaps as a governing class, among the people they found there.</p>

<p>From 1400 to 1300 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, while Type C was dominant, there
appears to have been little movement. The exodus of fifty years earlier
had perhaps given ample elbow room to those who were left behind. But
soon after 1300 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> we find two movements, more or less
simultaneous, but going in opposite directions.</p>

<p>The first of these movements seems to have started from the valley
of the Save, perhaps over the Predil pass into the Friuli, but more
probably, as Peet<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> has suggested, through Bosnia and Herzegovina,
and across the Adriatic into Italy. If the latter course were taken,
the invaders landed not far from Ascoli Piceno, and most of them passed
up the valley of the Trento, by the pass through which the Via Salaria
afterwards ran, to the valley of the Velino. Here they settled in that
fold of the Apennines between lakes Trasimene and Fucino, through which
run, in opposite directions, the Velino and the upper waters of the
Tiber. This band of invaders must have been a relatively small one, as
the area they occupied is not extensive and was very sharply defined.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 25.&mdash;TYPE G<br />
SWORD FROM FINLAND.</p>
</div>

<p>The other movement went to the east, and was probably that great
emigration from Europe to Asia of which dim recollections survived
among the Greeks, and which took the Briges into Asia Minor, where they
became Phrygians.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> It also carried to Thrace some, at any rate, of
its red-haired people.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> It was probably some stragglers from this
group who passed southwards, like knight-errants destroying monsters and
punishing evil doers, and who eventually became kings over the towns of
Mycenean Greece. These were known later as Ach√¶ans, and may possibly
have included also stragglers from the group which had passed over to
Italy.</p>

<p>It was between 1200 and 1175 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> that the next movement began,
and this was mainly to the west and north. Some of these invaders left
the Danube basin, crossed the Rhine, and passing through the Belfort
gap, entered France, and over-ran the greater part of that country.
Until the swords of this type have been catalogued and mapped, it will
be impossible to trace their line of advance, or to determine how far
they went. Some of these seem to have passed either down the Rhine or up
the east of France, for they crossed over to Britain, landing for the
most part in the Thames and by the Wash, or else at some intermediate
points. They seem to have settled in the east of England, and
subsequently in Wessex, but later waves of them evidently set out for
Ireland, crossing Wales by the upper Severn valley and the Bala cleft. A
considerable number of these seem to have settled in Ireland.</p>

<p>It was about this time that others set out from Hungary through the
Moravian gate, and while some went northwards, the majority passed
along Galicia, across the Bukovina and Podolia, and arrived at length
by the banks of the Koban. Here they settled for a time, and entered
into trade relations with a humble tribe, living on the southern slopes
of the Caucasus, from whom they learned the knowledge of iron. Armed
with swords with iron blades, they returned to the Danube basin about
1100 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and perhaps worked the iron mines at Gyalar, in
Transylvania. Then they settled in the Hungarian plain and in the north
of the Balkan peninsula. About 1050 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> a large body of these
people from the Koban passed southwards and descended the Vardar valley.
By degrees they passed thence to Thessaly. Then they began that slow
but steady conquest of the Greek states, which is known as the Dorian
invasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>A little later, about 1000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, the Koban folk, with their
iron swords, began pushing up the Danube, the Drave and the Save. In
the valley of the last they found whole mountains of iron, which they
began to work, and by 900 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, if not earlier, they had
reached Styria and the Salzkammergut, and were working the salt mines
at Hallstatt. It was, perhaps, earlier than this that they moved up
the Danube valley as far as Ulm and Sigmaringen, and soon after their
arrival there quarrels arose between them and the lords of the mountain
zone. It must have been before 900 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> that the newcomers
destroyed the lake-dwellings and expelled their inhabitants, who fled
from them to the north and west.</p>

<p>The refugees who went northwards were few in number, though some of them
seem to have fled a long way, perhaps even to Finland. Large numbers
escaped to France, and spread over most of that land except Brittany and
the extreme west. But here they were followed by the men of the iron
sword, who pursued them in every direction, except down the valley of
the Seine.</p>

<p>A great number of these refugees reached Britain, landing mostly at the
mouth of the Thames, and sailing up it as far as Reading. An important
settlement was made at &ldquo;Old England,&rdquo; at the mouth of the Brent, and
doubtless elsewhere by the Thames. They advanced across the south of
England, where, as we have seen, some of their predecessors were living,
and settled at All Cannings and doubtless other places in Wiltshire.
They pushed on into South Wales, making settlements on the open hills
above Cardiff. Some of these, too, reached Ireland.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the men of the iron sword, pursuing these refugees, followed
them in every direction across France, except down the valley of the
Seine. They went northwards down the valleys of the Meuse and Moselle,
entered Belgium,<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> and perhaps even entered Denmark. There seems no
evidence, however, that they crossed to Britain.</p>

<p>One further raid was made by the men of the iron sword, and this was
on an extensive scale. Some time after 900 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> a number of
them, coming from the Save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> valley, crossed the Predil pass. Some of
these stayed for a time at Santa Lucia Tolmino, in the Isonzo valley,
while the majority proceeded to Cividale in the Friuli plain. They
passed on rapidly to the Po valley, and destroyed the villages of the
Terramara-folk who lived there, expelling the inhabitants as seems to
have been the invariable custom of these men of blood and iron.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> The
Terramara-folk fled, some to Etruria, others to Taranto and others again
to Rome, where they built a dry terramara on the Palatine Hill.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> The
iron sword people passed on and settled at the foot of the Apennines,
with their centre at Bologna, introducing into all the region north-east
of the mountains the culture known to arch√¶ologists as that of
Villa-nova.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>As we have seen in Chapter IV., the Etruscans had been for some little
time settled in Tuscany, where they had established their trading
cities governed by religious magistrates. Before long these Etruscan
Prospectors found themselves face to face with this newly-arrived
war-like people. I have already given my reasons for thinking that
the Villa-nova folk conquered the Etruscans, and that together they
extended their empire, which is said to have reached to Pompeii. They
perhaps succeeded in pressing back the leaf-shaped sword people from the
neighbourhood of Lake Trasimene, but did not apparently succeed at first
in dislodging them from the valley of the Velino.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the leaf-shaped sword folk, mainly the people of the
mountain zone, have at one time or another invaded and in some way or
another conquered nearly all Europe except the Iberian peninsula, while
at the close of the bronze age they arrived as refugees in Celtic lands.
The iron sword folk, the people of the plain, who had learned the use of
iron in the Koban, followed them, making a complete conquest of Greece,
of Italy north of the Apennines, of France all but the west and the
Seine valley, Belgium and perhaps other regions further north. These
people did not conquer Scandinavia, nor did they reach Britain, at any
rate until several more centuries had elapsed.</p>

C<span class="smaller">HAPTER</span> XII<br />

<span class="s5">THE ARYAN CRADLE</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">D<span class="smaller">URING</span> the middle
half of the nineteenth century the minds of many
European savants were focussed upon what was termed the Aryan
hypothesis, which was investigated with more enthusiasm than discretion
by comparative philologists in England and France, and with still
greater vigour in Germany. Since then the general conclusions of these
mid-nineteenth century speculations have been current among politicians
and journalists, who talk glibly about Teutons and Celts and Slavs,
and that medley of races and peoples, who still continue to use in a
modified form the speech imposed upon them by their Roman conquerors,
and are therefore called the Latin race. Such terms, meaningless though
they are as applied to nations, have become popular during the last half
century, with disastrous results, since they have been used to emphasise
certain divisions which were growing up among European peoples, and
which in their turn did much to give rise to the European war, and are
still retarding the Peace for which everyone is longing.</p>

<p>The idea was first put forward in 1786, when Sir William Jones,<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
in a communication to the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, pointed out
the similarities between the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, German and Celtic
languages, but little progress was made until in 1833&ndash;5 Bopp<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
published his comparative grammar. For the next fifty years the
hypothesis grew at a great pace. The world was anxious for a scientific
classification of its peoples, especially of the peoples of Europe.
Men were also enquiring what had happened in this continent before
early Greek legend and literature began to lift the veil. The sciences
of anthropology and prehistoric arch√¶ology were in their infancy, and
unable to provide answers to these questions, and the comparative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
philologists, from the evidence of language alone, were prepared to give
full and most detailed explanations.</p>

<p>Thus arose the Aryan hypothesis, forced upon an eagerly inquiring public
with great enthusiasm and complete, or almost complete, agreement. But
during the eighties rifts appeared to disturb this harmony, anthropology
and arch√¶ology began to claim a hearing, and to disagree with the
conclusions of philology. By 1890 the philological enthusiasm died out,
at least in this country and in France, though for a time it lingered
on in Germany. All those acquainted with the subject felt that the
question needed reconsideration, partly in the light of more accurate
philological study, and especially having regard to the newer evidence
being produced in such quantities by the sciences of anthropology and
prehistoric arch√¶ology. The general public, however, continued to talk
and to write, with more confidence than before, of Teutons, Celts, Slavs
and the Latin races.</p>

<p>A word as to the term Aryan. When it was found that Sanskrit was allied
to most of the European languages, it was felt that a term was needed to
describe the group. Bopp, thinking that the German or Teutonic group was
the most westerly, as the Indian dialects were the most easterly, used
the term Indo-Germanic, which had previously been suggested by Klaproth
in 1823.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> But when it was fully realised that the Celtic tongues
were also included in the group, French and Italian scholars, who felt
that the term German was receiving too much prominence, suggested the
name Indo-European. Neither of these terms is quite accurate and both
are clumsy, so to avoid the latter defect Professor Max-M√ºller suggested
the term Aryan. This, too, is misleading, for the Aryas were the noble
caste among the Vedic Indians and the early Persians. The name, however,
is convenient, and is still used by many people, especially in this
country. Recently Dr. Giles<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> has suggested for the original people
who spoke these tongues the name of <em>Wiros</em>, as words similar to this,
meaning <em>men</em>, occur in most of these languages. The term has much to
recommend it, and it will be used in the following pages for the first
users of this speech.</p>

<p>When the connection between these languages was first realised, it was
felt that all the tongues had been derived from a primitive mother
speech, and that this primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> speech must have been spoken originally
by a small group of people, the primitive Aryans, or, as we shall call
them, the Wiros. But owing to loose thinking all the people who speak
these languages to-day, as well as those who have spoken them in the
past, were considered Aryans, and it was assumed that because their
languages were related they were racially identical. As long as this
applied only to European peoples no one raised any protest, but when
Max-M√ºller asserted that the same blood runs in the veins of English
soldiers as in the veins of the darkest Bengalese,<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> the Nordic
spirit in this country, which, as we have seen, is prone to race
exclusiveness, rose in its wrath, and the whole generalisation was
questioned.</p>

<p>It was then shown that languages could be imposed by conquerors upon
their subjects, and that there were instances on record of the reverse
process taking place, as in the case of the Frankish invaders of Gaul
and the Viking settlers in Normandy. People then, with equal lack of
lucid thinking, ran to the opposite extreme and said, &ldquo;there is now no
Aryan race, and there never has been one.&rdquo; To Penka<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> is due the
credit of making the matter clear. He pointed out that Aryan blood is
not co-extensive with Aryan speech. He showed that those who use the
latter are of several distinct anthropological types, but he argued that
the primitive Aryans or Wiros must have been of one type.</p>

<p>Penka&rsquo;s contention seems eminently reasonable and, one would think,
incontrovertible, for a group of languages, so closely resembling one
another, must have grown up in a somewhat restricted area, among a
people who had, during the formative period of the language, little
intercourse with the outside world. The very conditions which would
produce a specialised type of language, would, we may feel sure, have
produced an equally specialised type of men, that is to say, a race in
the anthropological meaning of the term.</p>

<p>The failure of Penka&rsquo;s views to carry widespread conviction was, I
am inclined to think, due to the fact that his theory involved the
identification of the primitive Wiros with the Nordic race. There is
really no valid objection to this view, and, as will be seen later,
the evidence which I am adducing points to a similar conclusion. But,
unfortunately, this theory became associated with certain political
opinions, and so became distasteful to those with a different outlook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>The original supporters of the Aryan hypothesis fell so in love with
the languages and with the people who originally developed them, that
they grew to believe that these Wiros were superior creatures, with a
superior tongue, which they had imposed upon an inferior world. All good
things found in the civilisation of Europe were attributed to them,
and they became the super-men. As far as we can ascertain from the
linguistic evidence available they had, it is true, evolved a language
which, owing to its flexibility, was capable of great things, but it
is by no means clear that the higher developments, which some of the
tongues have reached, would have been attained had not the Wiros mixed
with people possessing other ideas and other idioms. The evidence of
linguistic pal√¶ontology shows that in material culture they were very
backward, and, as we shall see later on, all the arch√¶ological evidence
tends to show that in these respects they were far behind the peoples
whom they conquered, and on whom they imposed their tongue. Their
one important characteristic seems to have been their incapacity for
learning other languages, and so insisting that other folk should adopt
theirs. This may have been due to lack of linguistic ability, or to an
overbearing conceit. Probably it was due to both. The original Wiros,
then, as judged by linguistic evidence, were far from being super-men.</p>

<p>Another fallacy has been the belief that the Nordic is the superior
person, the &ldquo;white man&rdquo; <em>par excellence</em>. The Nordic is strong, robust
and courageous, and possesses certain manly qualities which are much
admired; also he has taken care for some thousands of years to impress
upon his neighbours that these are admirable qualities. The Nordic has
also other good points, such as honesty and a genius for administration,
but he is far from possessing a monopoly of the virtues, and in many
respects falls behind members of the other European races. The works
of Gobineau<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> and later of Madison Grant<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> have enumerated his
virtues without defining his limitations, and no one, so far as I know,
has yet written to extol the excellencies of the Alpine or Mediterranean
races, who have contributed and still contribute much of what is good in
the make-up of modern Europe.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the nineteenth century the Germans were
engaged in making and consolidating their empire, and to do this
they wished to encourage their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> nationals to believe that Germans,
<em>qua</em> Germans, were the inheritors of many, in fact of most admirable
qualities. As a matter of fact such &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; ideas were current
in most countries, as can be seen by an examination of the school
text-books, especially history books, in use at that time, and
sometimes, too, at the present day. Only in this, as is their wont, the
Germans were very thorough, and they pressed every science and every
hypothesis into their service.</p>

<p>What was read into the hypothesis of Penka, though it does not follow
that he wished it, was that these Wiros or Aryan super-men were the same
as the Nordic super-men, and that their home was in Germany, as could
easily be proved from the pages of Tacitus. It was implied that from
Germany had come all that was Aryan or Nordic or really valuable in the
population of other countries, and that, therefore, the Aryan Nordic
Germans were the salt of the earth. This view, which grew up insensibly
from the hypothesis of Penka and others, was caught hold of by those who
were wishing to transform the peaceful Alpine German into an aggressive
militarist, and in its full absurdity was given to the world by a
renegade Englishman, Herr Houston Chamberlain.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>Now, as we have seen, the original Wiros, though they had their good
points, had by no means a monopoly of the virtues, and were enabled to
spread their tongues largely by their incapacity and unwillingness to
learn the speech of others. The Nordic is a picturesque and romantic
figure, with many admirable qualities, but is seldom clever, skilful
with his hands or patient in research. Lastly, an examination of the
physical types, as they exist to-day in Germany, shows us that outside
the former kingdom of Hanover, the Nordic type is rare.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> There are
probably as many pure Nordics in France, distributed over the northern
departments from Dunkirk almost to the west of Brittany, as will be
found in the German empire. There is this difference only between the
populations of the two countries. In Germany the fair colouring of the
Nordic element seems to be a dominant character over the relatively dark
pigmentation of the Alpine; so we meet with a majority of people having
broad Alpine heads but fair Nordic colouration. In France, on the other
hand, there is a large Mediterranean element, surviving from neolithic
days, and the brunette colouring of this race is more dominant than the
blondness of the Nordic. As all three types have mingled in France, fair
hair is less frequently found among those with broad heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>The use made of the Aryan Nordic equation by German political
propagandists has inclined, French and, to some extent, English writers,
to reject this view. This objection has been in a large measure due to
misunderstandings, and in any case it is unscientific to allow national
and political prejudices to influence our opinions on such questions.</p>

<p>If, then, we agree with Penka that there must have been an original
Aryan race, or, as we shall call them, Wiros, it is important to
ascertain what part of the world it was, from which these languages
spread to Ireland and Bengal. This is the problem of the Aryan cradle.</p>

<p>In the early days of the hypothesis students noted that Sanskrit was the
most archaic of the languages, and forgetting that the Vedic hymns were
composed 1000 or 1500 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, while the earliest Greek literature
dated from 800 or 900 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, there was a tendency to derive
the whole group from North India.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> Subsequently, when the close
connection between Sanskrit and Zend, the ancient Persian tongue, was
recognised, and it was realised that the Vedic folk were recent arrivals
in the Punjab when the Vedic hymns were being composed, the Aryan cradle
was removed to the region watered by the Oxus and the Jaxartes, and the
slopes of the Hindu Kush.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>Here the cradle remained for a long time. Pott, hypnotised by his
aphorism <em>ex oriente lux</em>, drew a wonderful picture of the westward
advance of the Wiros from their eastern home. Others filled in, largely
from their own imaginations, the remaining details. And so we get the
mid-nineteenth century view of these Aryan super-men, with a language
containing potentialities of all that is fine in literature, with a
social organisation and morality which was to reform benighted Europe,
worshipping deities which were the products either of solar or chthonic
myths or of diseases of language, setting forth from the western slopes
of the Himalayan <em>massif</em>, urged on &ldquo;by an irresistible impulse&rdquo; towards
the setting sun, migrating westward and ever westward, carrying their
wives and families in the famous Aryan cart provided for them by a
distinguished anthropologist.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Such was the view unanimously held by
all Europe, and which figures still in too many text-books. One man only
was left crying in the wilderness, or at least in the steppe, and he was
an Englishman. As Hehn<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> wrote in 1874,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> &ldquo;so it came to pass that in
England, the native land of fads, there chanced to enter into the head
of an eccentric individual the notion of placing the cradle of the Aryan
race in Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those of us who live &ldquo;in that land of fads&rdquo; may well be proud of Dr.
Latham, who advanced these views in 1851, and subsequently enlarged
upon them.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> In due course nearly all other philologists followed
suit, and Max-M√ºller alone was unrepentent, and as late as 1887 wrote &ldquo;I
should still say, as I said forty years ago, &lsquo;Somewhere in Asia,&rsquo; and
no more.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> But by then the Asiatic cradle had gone to the limbo of
exploded hypotheses.</p>

<p>In 1868 Benfey, in a preface to Fick&rsquo;s work,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> acknowledged the value
of Latham&rsquo;s protests, and, arguing for the first time from the type
of evidence known as linguistic pal√¶ontology, advocated a European as
distinguished from an Asiatic cradle, and suggested, as Latham had done
earlier, the region north of the Black Sea. He was followed in 1871 by
Geiger,<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> who with national pride wished to prove that the super-man
had always lived in the plain of North Germany, to which, some years
later, Pi√®trement<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> retorted by suggesting that Geiger&rsquo;s arguments
would apply equally well to the neighbourhood of Lake Balkash and the
Ala-tau mountains.</p>

<p>In the same year in which Geiger&rsquo;s work appeared Cuno made a notable
contribution to the hypothesis.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> He contended that the original
undivided Wiros were not a small clan, but must have been a numerous,
nomad pastoral people, inhabiting an extensive steppe region. For
the evolution of the parent tongue with its elaborate grammar a long
period, several thousands of years, must have been needed, and during
this time the Wiros must have moved freely over the area of the cradle,
having frequent intercourse with one another, but little or none with
outsiders. These conditions, he thought, could only be obtained on a
vast plain, undivided by lofty mountain barriers or impassable forests;
this cradle must have been in a temperate climate, tolerably uniform
in character, where there would have been ample room for the growth of
a numerous people. Such an area can only be found in the great plain
of Northern Europe, stretching from the north of France to the Ural
mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Further investigation has shown that much of this plain was filled with
dense forests and impassable morasses, but that the open steppe begins
in Russia, and extends uninterruptedly to the slopes of the Hindu Kush,
with certain westward prolongations, especially the sandy heaths to the
north of the Carpathians, stretching from the Russian steppe, across
Galicia, to the neighbourhood of Breslau. North of this, too, is a belt
of parkland, opening on to the steppe, where nomad herdsmen could drive
their cattle when the grass of the steppe became burnt up. Here, it
would seem, was an area which would meet the needs of the linguistic
pal√¶ontologist, and it was in this region that the Aryan cradle was
placed by Dr. Schrader in 1883,<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> and here it has remained without
opposition until quite recently.</p>

<p>During the last few months there has appeared the first volume of the
Cambridge History of India, to which Dr. Peter Giles had contributed
a chapter on the Aryans.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> In this, in which he has repeated his
suggestion that these people should in future be called Wiros, he has
put forward views which differ in material respects from those hitherto
held. His suggestion is, in fact, that the Aryan cradle is to be sought
for in the plain of Hungary.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to views previously advanced, he believes that the
original Wiros were settled agriculturists and not nomad herdsmen.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
He bases this conclusion, apparently, on the fact that they knew of
corn. A careful study of all the evidence on this subject collected by
Schrader<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> convinces me, however, that it is far from certain that
the undivided Wiros were acquainted with cultivated grain, for the terms
used, few if any of which run through all the languages, may well apply
to wild grain, and oats grow wild on the Russian steppe,<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> and may
well have been used as food for man and beast. Moreover it is not an
unknown thing for nomad people to grow scratch crops of grain. Such
crops of barley I have myself seen grown by nomad Bedawin in the clay
deserts behind Alexandria. The steppe-folk, too, like most nomads, were
probably in the habit of making occasional raids on the settled lands on
their margin, and we have actual evidence that this occurred. We know
also that settled cultivators were living both at Tripolje and at Anau
on the edge of the steppe. The original Wiro word for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> grain might well
be the name they used for this kind of booty, nor need we exclude the
possibility that when times were hard they acquired grain by trade from
their settled neighbours, as Abraham, a nomad steppe-man, purchased corn
from Egypt. The argument from the words for grain seems indecisive, and
the balance of the evidence cited by Schrader seems in favour of a nomad
existence.</p>

<p>Dr. Giles feels that &ldquo;the close similarity between the various languages
spoken by them would lead us to infer that they must have lived for long
in a severely circumscribed area, so that their peculiarities developed
for many generations in common.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> This, as we have seen, was Cuno&rsquo;s
idea, and is an eminently sound conclusion. But Dr. Giles would see
in this circumscribed area one surrounded with a ring of mountains,
while Cuno thought that it demanded an extensive steppe. The difference
between the two views seems to depend upon whether the Wiros were nomad
or settled, and I have already given reasons for believing them to have
been nomads.</p>

<p>Dr. Giles objects to the steppe-cradle. He gives as his reason that
this region has not on the whole the characteristics required by the
conclusions drawn from linguistic pal√¶ontology;<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> on the other hand
Schrader, who has studied this side of philology more exhaustively than
most inquirers, believes that the conditions are fulfilled.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Neither
argument is perhaps conclusive, and both deserve serious attention; the
decision must rest upon evidence drawn from those other sciences which
deal with the far past.</p>

<p>We have found reason for believing that in neolithic days the Russian
steppe east of the Dnieper was inhabited by a nomad steppe-folk, who
had domesticated horses and cattle, and perhaps sheep. As they lived on
a plain they had probably not met with the goat, which is a mountain
beast, and it is to be noted that the name for goat varies in nearly
all the Wiro languages.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> These nomad steppe-folk, who buried their
dead in a contracted position covered with red ochre under kurgans or
barrows, were, we believe, Nordic or proto-Nordic in type, and some,
at least, of their skeletons remind us of the Br√ºnn-Brux-Combe Capelle
type,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> who hunted horses in late Aurignacian and Solutrean times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>The state of civilisation and the area of distribution of those nomad
steppe-folk exactly corresponds with the requirements of the early
Wiros as postulated by Schrader, though it differs in some respects
from those demanded by Giles. On the other hand, in Magdalenian and
Azilian times, and perhaps during the earlier phases of the neolithic
age, the ancestors of these people may well have lived in the Hungarian
plain, and we have seen how some of them survived in Switzerland, at
Chamblandes, well into neolithic times.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>It is possible, then, that the circumscribed area, though not the
settled agricultural condition, demanded by Dr. Giles, may have been
true in the later phases of the upper pal√¶olithic age. This, however, he
will not agree to, for he is persuaded that the <em>hiatus</em>, assumed by the
earlier arch√¶ologists, still exists, and that the upper pal√¶olithic age,
as well as the lower, preceded the last ice age and belongs to a very
remote past.</p>

<p>Some arch√¶ologists, it is true, still hold to these views, and this
inflated chronology has not yet been abandoned by all. During the last
few years, however, the shorter dating<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> has become more generally
accepted, and this brings the whole of the neanthropic period into
relatively recent times, and gives us a continuous history from the
Aurignacian period to the present day. If Dr. Giles could be persuaded
to accept these more modern views on pal√¶olithic chronology, many of his
difficulties would be removed, and he might agree to place the Hungarian
cradle of the Wiros in the latter part of the upper pal√¶olithic age.</p>

<p>Dr. Giles raises objections also to the continuity of the
Russio-Turkestan steppe, and maintains that a connection between
South Russia and the east, north of the Black Sea, would have been
impossible.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> He is, therefore, disposed to take the Wiros to Persia
and India by way of Asia Minor.</p>

<p>The great objection which he cites to the northern passage is the
existence of the barren Ust Urt desert. Also the fact that the Caspian
has steadily been becoming more shallow and contracting in area. These
two points, if true, to some extent contradict one another. It is true,
doubtless, that at one time the Caspian had covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> a greatly extended
area, but it is not so clear that its contraction has been a steady
progress. We have already seen, from the evidence cited by Ellsworth
Huntington,<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> that this contraction and expansion has probably
been intermittent. In any case, the contraction has been due to light
rainfall, and it is this light rainfall which has produced the desert
condition of the Ust Urt. When the Caspian expanded, it was because of
increased precipitation, when such parts of the Ust Urt as were not
inundated would have been a grassy steppe.</p>

<p>Dr. Giles suggests that at one time the Caspian and Aral seas were one
great inland sea, and that such was at one time the case is implied
by extracts from the writings of Herodotus.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> But though this was
almost certainly the case during periods of relatively heavy rainfall,
the level would have to have risen well above the 200 metre contour to
have obstructed the passage between the Russian and Turkestan steppes.
Such a rise is quite unthinkable during the last 6000 years, for had the
surface been raised 220 feet above the present sea level the Caspio-Aral
Sea would have been connected with the Euxine.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Even had the
impossible occurred and the 200 metre contour been reached it would have
been quite easy to pass from one steppe area to another, by crossing the
southern slopes of the Urals, which are raised very little above the
plain and would form no obstacle to nomad tribes.</p>

<p>The Anatolian passage was by no means an easy route to the east, for
had the Wiros kept to the north they would have found difficulty in
crossing the Armenian mountains; further south they would have come
into contact with the peoples of Mesopotamia, and we should have found
evidence of their presence. That some of them passed this way about 2200
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span> we have already seen, but others had passed eastwards
earlier, apparently by a different route, for otherwise it is difficult
to account for the presence of the Kassites on the Iranian plateau
in the time of Hammurabi. The complete absence of any evidence of a
movement eastward from the Hungarian plain in neolithic days, and the
fact that any such movement would have been compelled to cross the area
occupied by the settled Tripolje-folk, seem to be fatal to the literal
acceptance of this hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking all factors, anthropological and arch√¶ological, geographical
and linguistic, into consideration, and in spite of the difference
in opinion expressed by Dr. Giles, whose authority to pronounce on
the linguistic data all must acknowledge, I am venturing to identify
the nomad steppe-folk with the primitive Wiros, while admitting the
possibility that the beginnings of their language may date back to
Magdalenian and Azilian times, when they may have been living surrounded
by the Carpathian ring.</p>

identified. Certain affinities to the group have also been noted in the
Hittite language, which has been claimed by some writers to be a true
Wiro tongue.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> But this view has not received general acceptance.
Little use, however, has been made of this fresh evidence towards
solving the problem of the Aryan cradle.</p>

<p>But early in 1891 an important communication was made to the
Philological Society by Professor, afterwards Sir, John Rhys.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> This
paper raised a storm of hostile criticism, especially in Germany,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>
and its conclusions have not found favour in philological circles. As,
however, some of Sir John&rsquo;s conclusions coincide in certain particulars
with the reconstruction offered in the previous pages, based on other
evidence, the thesis demands reconsideration.</p>

<p>To summarise briefly, Rhys pointed out that the Celtic languages, now
confined to the north-western fringe of Europe, fell naturally into two
well-defined groups. One of these, the Gaelic, or as he preferred to
call it the Goidelic, was spoken in Ireland, North-West Scotland and
the Isle of Man. The other, formerly called Cymric, but by Rhys styled
Brythonic, was spoken in Wales, Cornwall and Brittany. There are several
marked differences between these two groups of languages, the most
important being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> that the C in the Goidelic, which represents an earlier
Q or Qu, is replaced in Brythonic by a P or perhaps a B. Thus the Celtic
languages fall into two well-defined groups which may be called the Q
and P dialects.</p>

<p>Rhys pointed out, too, that in the Italian peninsula the same phenomenon
appeared. In Latin, and the dialects most closely allied to it, Q or Qu
was found, while in the Umbrian forms of speech, used over the greater
part of the peninsula this sound was replaced by P. Thus there were Q
and P dialects in Italy also.</p>

<p>He further pointed out that the Greek language, with certain exceptions,
was a true P dialect, for the Latin <em>equus</em> corresponded to the Greek
&#7985;&#960;&#960;&#8001;&#962;. He suggested, however, that the Ionic dialect used by
Herodotus and Hippocrates, which frequently had a &#954; where the
standard Greek had a &#960;,<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> was a descendant of a form of Q speech,
but that the Qu had degenerated into &#954;, as it had into C in
Goidelic.</p>

<p>Further, he pointed out that the Q dialects, Goidelic, Latin and Ionic
Greek, formed so to speak an outer ring, while Brythonic, Umbrian and
standard Greek lay within them. He argued from this that these tongues
had spread in two waves from a common centre, which he fixed in the
mountain zone of Central Europe, and thence the Q tongues had spread by
invasion, to be followed some few centuries later by a second invasion
of P people, who had driven the Q people further from the original home.</p>

<p>He suggested that the change of Q into P had been effected by a
conquering group of aliens, who had adopted the Wiro tongue from their
subjects, but retained some details of the phonological laws of their
original language, which accounted for this labialisation. He further
suggested that these alien invaders were the Alpine inhabitants of the
Swiss lake-dwellings.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>This paper was received with hostile criticism and derision, especially
by some German students of Celtic tongues.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> It had little better
reception in France, and the British and Irish Celtic scholars, with a
few exceptions, treated the idea with contempt. The theory has never
received the consideration and fair criticism which a paper from so
eminent an authority on Celtic languages deserved.</p>

<p>The main facts as to the Celtic and Italic dialects are not in dispute.
There can be no question that in both of those areas both Q and P groups
are or were in existence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> and that the Q are in the outer and the P in
the inner ring. With regard to Greek however, the case is different, and
it is generally considered that the dialect of Herodotus and Hippocrates
is purely local and not necessarily primitive, and it has been pointed
out that had the original Ionic dialect been a Q tongue, signs of this
would have been apparent in Homer. It is also becoming more common to
consider Greek as having closer affinities with Persian than with Italic
or Celtic, though one wonders whether this connection is not being
exaggerated as the pendulum swings from the over-estimated resemblance
formerly recognised between the two languages of the Classical world.</p>

<p>We must, however, agree that the Greek part of Rhys&rsquo; hypothesis will
not stand, at least without considerable emendation, nor have we
found from our arch√¶ological investigations any reasons for believing
that the Alpine inhabitants of the Swiss lake-dwellings over-ran as
conquerors the surrounding regions. The evidence, in fact, points in an
opposite direction. The deletion of these two points is not fatal to the
hypothesis, and we may still consider that there is, on philological
evidence, a <em>prima-facie</em> reason for believing that from somewhere in
Central Europe, from the area which we have termed the Celtic cradle,
two waves of invaders, of Wiro speech if not of Wiro race, set out in
various directions, that the Q was the earlier and the P the later, and
that both entered Italy and the Celtic lands.</p>

<p>We may further admit the possibility or even the probability, that an
alien element, not necessarily non-Wiro, had entered the Celtic cradle
before the departure of the second wave, and that it was to this alien
element that the labialisation was due. Lastly, we may admit that,
though evidence of the Q wave into Greece is non-proven, there is no
doubt of the arrival of the P people, but these P people spoke a tongue
showing greater affinities with Iranian speech, especially in their
names for weapons and other warlike paraphernalia,<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> than is to be
recognised in the other P tongues.</p>

<p>Now we have seen from the study of arch√¶ological evidence that the men
of the leaf-shaped sword passed at one time into Italy, where they
settled near Lake Fucino, and a little later some entered the Celtic
lands of the west, while earlier a few adventurers reached Greek lands.
Later some refugees from the mountain zone reached many parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> of
France and the British Isles. All these seem to have come from the same
Celtic cradle and to have been of the same racial type or, to speak
more accurately, types. Later still, we have seen that the Koban folk,
who had learned the use of iron in the neighbourhood of the Caucasus,
returned to the Danube valley, after which some of them entered Greece
as Dorians, while others entered Italy with the Villa-nova culture and a
third group pursued their predecessors over all parts of France except
the Seine valley. It seems possible, if not probable, that these two
waves of invasions may have been those which brought Q and P speech
respectively into these different parts of Europe. If this equation
be accepted, the main features of Sir John Rhys&rsquo; hypothesis have been
proved. But it will not be wise to jump too hastily to a conclusion, for
the fact that there were two waves of invaders and two of Wiro dialects
may be only a coincidence. We must attempt to apply a confirmatory test.</p>

<p>In Greece we have seen that Casson has shown good cause why we should
believe that the advance of the men with the iron sword should be
equated with the Dorian invasion. The Dorians spoke a P dialect and may
well have been the first to introduce such a tongue into Greece. We have
seen how Rhys&rsquo; view that Q dialects survive in the writings of Herodotus
and Hippocrates is open to question, but we have also noted that Wace
had equally questioned the &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; invasion proposed by Ridgeway. I
have already put forward an amended scheme for the latter, and suggested
the arrival of only a few Nordic adventurers. Had these been Wiros of
Q speech, they could not, owing to the paucity of their numbers, have
imposed their tongue upon their subjects. If, therefore, we accept the
equation for Greek lands, we need not expect to find evidence of the
survival of Q speech in Greece in the fifth century.</p>

<p>But I have suggested that these &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; adventurers were stragglers
from the band of Nordics who were responsible for the Phrygian invasion
of Asia Minor. If the equation, which we are endeavouring to prove, were
true, we should expect that the Phrygian language was of the Q form.
Unfortunately we know little of the Phrygian tongue even in the palmy
days of Athens, still less of its form in the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>All philologists are agreed that with the language of Thrace it formed
the Thraco-Phrygian group, from which, according to some philologists,
modern Albanian is derived. Dacian is also believed to have belonged
to the same group. Some years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> ago Dr. Tomaschek collected together,
from Greek and Latin sources, all the words which might be considered
as belonging to this group, but most of these are place-names or names
of plants. This is not very satisfactory material for our purpose, for
place-names may have been inherited from the previous inhabitants, while
names of plants may be loan words. Further than this most of the words
have been preserved by Greek writers, and there is no Q in the Greek
language. Still I have thought it well to search through the lists
compiled by Tomaschek, and though the result is, perhaps, not very
convincing, the presence of such words as &#954;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#962;, &#954;&#949;&#957;&#952;&#959;&#962;,
Quimedava or &#954;&#959;&#965;&#953;&#956;&#949;-&#948;&#945;&#946;&#945;, Coila or Cuila, &#954;&#949;&#961;&#954;&#953;&#957;&#951;, and
several others certainly hints that the Thraco-Phrygian tongues may have
been Q dialects.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>The arguments from the east, while they do not in any way contradict
our equation, and may even be said to give it some support, are not
quite decisive; at any rate something more conclusive is desirable.
It is useless to look for this in the west, in Celtic lands, for our
documentary evidence scarcely antedates the time of Julius C√¶sar, or,
at any rate, such earlier evidence as we possess is both meagre and
uncertain. Finally all the evidence has been the subject of dispute, on
almost every item differences of opinion have been expressed, and we
have no sure or unquestioned data on which to depend. The controversy
has also, unhappily, become associated with other differences of opinion.</p>

<p>It will be well, then, to leave for a time the consideration of the
Celtic evidence, and to endeavour to test our equation without reference
to the linguistic data of the west. There remains, then, only one other
area in which to search for our confirmatory test, the Italian peninsula.</p>

<p>Professor Conway<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> has given us to understand that the Osco-Umbrian
dialects, which were P languages, were spoken throughout Italy from
Umbria southwards, and doubtless, if we may judge from the statement of
Herodotus already quoted, as far north as the foot-hills of the Alps,
before the Gauls had invaded the valley of the Po. The only exceptions
to this spread of these dialects were Etruria, or the greater portion
of it, and a part of Latium, in which Latin dialects of the Q type
were spoken. These Latin dialects, Conway tells us, were spoken by the
Latini, the Marsi, the √Üqui, the Hernici,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> the Falisci, who dwelt within
the borders of Etruria, and to some extent by the Sabini.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>The linguistic position of the Sabines seems uncertain. In the passage
quoted Conway enumerates them among the tribes who spoke Q dialects,
but later on, when mentioning some of those who had P speech, he adds
in a footnote that perhaps Sabine should be included among these. The
position of the Sabine tongue is then uncertain. If this were so, the
same uncertainty may apply to the Faliscans, for little if anything is
known directly of their dialect, but Conway states that it is &ldquo;certain
that they were akin to the Sabines across the Tiber, and that their city
was subdued and governed by the Etruscans.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p>This leaves us with four tribes, who undoubtedly spoke Q languages,
the Latini, Marsi, √Üqui, and Hernici. The area occupied by them is
only roughly indicated by Conway, but I gather that he agrees with the
boundaries delineated by Kiepert.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> The map given in Fig. 26 gives
these bounds, and it will be seen that in many respects the region they
occupy agrees with the area in which all the Italian leaf-shaped swords
have been found. There are, however, certain marked differences.</p>

<p>Out of nine swords of Type D, four are found within the area of Q
speech, and one at Sulmona, only just outside and within the area
of Sabine speech. One is a stray, found somewhere in Apulia, and
three, together with one of Type C, have been found not far from Lake
Trasimene. The solitary sword of Type B, found at Ascoli, seems only to
indicate that the line of approach was from the east.</p>

<p>Thus it seems that there is a fair equation between the swords and Q
speech, but the latter must have been driven from the Trasimene region,
and pushed westward in the Sabine area. Of the former presence and
subsequent disappearances of the Q speech from the Trasimene region we
have no evidence, but we have seen that the Etruscans arrived later than
the leaf-shaped sword people and with a superior culture. We have also
found reason for suspecting that the Villa-nova folk, who arrived still
later, had made themselves a military aristocracy over the Etruscans,
and the conquest or expulsion may have been due to them. We have seen
that the Falisci, a tribe with Sabine affinities, were absorbed by the
Etruscans. There is nothing inherently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> impossible in the same fate
having overtaken the leaf-shaped sword people who had settled in the
region around Lake Trasimene.</p>

<p>But with regard to the westward move of the Q peoples, and to the
suggestion that they were driven from what was later Sabine territory,
we are not dependent wholly upon conjecture, for Dionysius of
Halicarnassus tells us that the tribes who occupied the region around
Rome, after the barbarian Siculi, were the Aborigines.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Whether
this term conveyed to Dionysius the same meaning as it does to us, or
whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> it was a corruption of a tribal name as some have thought,<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
does not concern us here. It is sufficient for our purpose that he
mentions that their original home lay to the east, in the valley of
the Velino and its tributary the Salto, which drains Lake Fucino. He
mentions by name many of their cities, and describes the position of
most of them. The sites of the majority have been identified, though
some yet remain unknown. Judging by what can be ascertained of their
position, we gather that the Aborigines occupied the Salto valley from
Marruvium, on the shores of Lake Fucino, as far as Reat√¶, where it joins
the Velino, and thence to the junction of the latter with the Nera.
One of their cities, Batia, lay considerably to the north, across the
Apennines, in the direction of Ascoli, where the Type B sword was found.
How far the territory of the Aborigines stretched towards Lake Trasimene
is uncertain, as the sites of some of their towns remain unidentified,
but several of them lay in that direction, outside the later area of Q
speech, but in Sabine territory.</p>

<p>Dionysius tells us that one night the Sabines issued from Amiternum
and seized Liste, the capital of the Aborigines, who retired to Reat√¶,
whence they endeavoured to recapture it.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> They appear to have been
successful eventually in recovering the land around Lake Fucino, but
would seem to have lost the territory to the north-west around Reat√¶.
About the same time many of them migrated south-westwards to the lands
around Rome.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> As one of their original cities had been called
Palatium it seems likely that it was they who gave its name to the
Palatine Hill.</p>

<p>The general agreement between the area in which we find the leaf-shaped
swords, the area occupied by the Aborigines before the Sabine
expedition, and the area of Q speech, suggests that these three are one
especially as there is a progressive abandonment of the north-western
portion and a movement towards the south-west near the mouth of the
Tiber. My suggestion is that the Aborigines were the descendants of
the leaf-shaped sword people and the ancestors of the Q speaking Latin
peoples of later days.</p>

<p>Umbrian speech, though it extended towards the south-east and surrounded
the Latin tongues, is found mainly on the north-east of the Apennines,
and seems to have come from that direction; before the advent of the
Gauls it reached, as we have seen, to the foot of the Alps. This is the
region in which we find the chief remains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> the Villa-nova culture,
which is not unlike that of the Dorians, so that it seems reasonable to
equate this culture with the Osco-Umbrian or P dialects.</p>

<p>The Sabines, as we have seen, are said to have come from Amiternum,
which is on the north-eastern slope of the Apennines, or rather in a
valley which opens out on that side. We should, therefore, expect them
to have been a P people. But, according to Dionysius, they over-ran a
region peopled by the Aborigines, who we have found reason for thinking
were a Q people, and, though doubtless they expelled the fighting men,
a good number are likely to have remained behind. It is not surprising,
therefore, that there should be some uncertainty as to whether the
original Sabines spoke a P or a Q dialect.</p>

<p>All the Italian evidence is consistent with the view that the men of the
leaf-shaped sword were Q speaking, while the men with the iron sword
spoke P tongues, but before we come finally to a decision, it might be
well to make a further test elsewhere. We have seen that the refugees
from the mountain zone, armed with Type G swords, fled down the Rhone,
the Loire, and the Seine, and that, while the men with the iron swords
pursued them down the two former valleys, they left the Seine valley
alone. Sir John Rhys and his supporters have suggested that Q speech
was at one time spoken in Gaul, and have cited certain place-names
in support of their case.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> The value of this evidence has been
disputed, but there is one name, in two forms, which so obviously
belongs to Q speech, that its value cannot well be denied, and this is
<em>Sequana</em>, the ancient name for the Seine, and <em>Sequani</em>, the tribe who
lived by its banks. It cannot be merely a coincidence that the best
attested Q names have been noted just where Type G swords are found
not followed by iron swords, and this case, bearing out as it does the
general tenour of the Italian evidence, seems to me to be conclusive.</p>

<p>I would submit, therefore, that the arch√¶ological evidence, which I have
given in this and in previous chapters, proves, as conclusively as the
circumstances of the case are likely to admit, that the thesis of Sir
John Rhys that two waves of people left Central Europe for Italy and the
west, the first speaking a Q and the second a P tongue, is absolutely
correct, though modifications need to be made in the application of this
theory to Greek lands. His view that the P Folk were the people of the
Swiss lake-dwellings we have seen good reason to reject.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XIV" id="Chapter_XIV"></a>
C<span class="smaller">HAPTER</span> XIV<br />

<span class="s5">THE WANDERINGS OF THE WIROS</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smaller"> HAVE</span> now cited
almost all the evidence which I have collected to solve
the question of the Aryan cradle and the dispersal of the Wiros from
Central Europe, especially of their raids into the Celtic lands of the
west. Except for a few details I have found myself in agreement with
other writers, sometimes with this, at others with that authority. This
is not surprising, for so many shots have been made, often at random,
and without sufficient evidence, that it would be strange if some of
them had not hit the mark.</p>

<p>Thus with Penka I have argued for an Aryan race, which was Nordic in
type, with Cuno that the primitive Wiro language developed on an open
plain, which, with Latham and Schrader, I have placed on the Russian
steppe. I have found myself in agreement with Sir John Rhys on the main
features of his thesis that the Q and P Wiros left Central Europe in
two successive waves, and I have argued that the Q Wiros were armed
with bronze leaf-shaped swords. This last suggestion has already been
hazarded in this country by Crawford,<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> though backed up with
inadequate evidence, and in France by M. Hubert,<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> with whose
evidence I am unacquainted, as his work dealing with the subject has not
appeared as I write.</p>

<p>But in all these cases I have endeavoured to support my argument, not
merely with philological data, as has been the case with most of my
predecessors, but with evidence drawn from anthropology and arch√¶ology.
The evidence from the Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> swords, backed up as it is by the absence
of Hallstatt iron swords from the Seine valley, seems so decisive that
I feel that the equation of the Q peoples with the spread of the bronze
swords is beyond dispute.</p>

<p>But if this general reconstruction of the early history of the Wiro
movements is to be considered correct, in outline at least, it must be
shown that it will fit in with all the linguistic evidence available; at
any rate that it is not incompatible with it. For that reason I propose
in this chapter to summarise briefly, as I conceive them, the wanderings
of the Wiros over Europe and Asia, from their first departure from
south-east Europe.</p>

<p>We have found reason for believing that before 3000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and
probably for long before that date, the Wiros had been occupying the
Russian steppes east of the Dnieper, and had perhaps wandered across the
Volga into Turkestan. They were a nomad people, living, perhaps, partly
by hunting, but mainly by herding cattle on the grassy steppes, and the
parklands which fringed them on the north. They had tamed the horse, and
held this animal in great veneration. Its name constantly occurs as part
of their own names,<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> they rode it like cow-boys &ldquo;punching&rdquo; their
cattle, and if we may judge from the habits of their descendants, it was
what may be described as a cult animal.</p>

<p>We have seen that they seem to have been of the Nordic type, but this
statement needs qualification. We are accustomed to speak of Nordics,
Alpines and Mediterraneans, and to describe their physical characters
in considerable detail. We are well aware that the population of every
country in Europe is mixed, and contains many examples of at least two
of these types and a larger number of individuals who resemble one type
in this feature and another in that; there are also many who display
intermediate characters. But from this mass of heterogeneous material
we believe that we have isolated these types, which we consider pure,
and we treat the bulk of the population as a mixture of these, varying
in its components and their proportions in each region. This postulates
that there was a time, the race-making period of some writers,<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>
when each of these races was living, pure and unmixed, in some area of
isolation.</p>

<p>That this position has led to clear thinking and has advanced the
science of physical anthropology is undoubted, but we have to consider
whether it represents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> a condition which has actually occurred. That
such a pure and homogeneous type would evolve if a community were
isolated from all others for a sufficient length of time is probable,
but we have no clear evidence that such a state of isolation has been
preserved for a sufficient period in any part of Europe, or for that
matter in the world. The Andamanese have for long kept themselves
in fairly complete isolation in a small group of islands, yet their
type seems to show evidence of admixture. The same is more true of
the Australian aborigines, although the island continent has almost
succeeded in keeping out other placental animals. It is true that as we
go back into the past, especially into early neolithic times, the skulls
in any given region appear more homogeneous than is the case at later
periods. After the forests had appeared in Magdalenian times, and until
the metal trade arose, communities seem to have been more isolated than
either before or after. This was, apparently, the race-making period
postulated by McDougall. But the communities who settled at that time
in these regions of isolation were to some extent of mixed ancestry,
and their isolation was not of sufficient length to insure absolute
homogeneity, though we find a closer approximation to it then than has
occurred since.</p>

<p>We have seen at the close of Chapter II. that what we have been
accustomed to consider the Mediterranean race is in reality a mixture
of several late pal√¶olithic types, all somewhat resembling one another
in their most conspicuous features, and the same seems to have been
true of the Nordic Wiros, during their race-making period on the
Russian steppe. Unfortunately we have no very long series of skulls to
study, and in the case of some we are uncertain whether they belong
to this or to a slightly later date. But Sergi has described a series
of ninety-one,<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> which will give us some idea of their range of
variation. Thirty-six of these skulls have indices varying from
seventy-three to seventy-six, thirty-one more between seventy-one and
seventy-eight, while the remaining twenty-four range outside these from
sixty-five to eighty-one. Many of these skulls are very high, and so
conform to the type of Br√ºnn-Brux-Combe Capelle, and this has led Fleure
to suspect that this late pal√¶olithic type, the essentially intrusive
element into the west of Solutrean times, is present in considerable
numbers among these steppe-folk.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> According to Sergi fifty-one out
of the ninety-one show this feature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> and these are distributed pretty
generally among all indices from sixty-five to seventy-nine.</p>

<p>Again, Bogdanov has given us reason for believing that two races
were inhabiting the government of Moscow during the kurgan period.
&ldquo;One of these races was robust, with a large and long head, an
elongated face, and, according to some examples, with hair more or
less fair. The other, smaller and more poverty stricken, belongs to
a brachycephalic people, having a shorter face, a wider and shorter
head, and chestnut hair.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> He shows, too, that in the centre of
the area the long-headed type was purest, and cites twenty-three
skulls from the kurgans of Souja, in the government of Kursk, of which
nineteen were true dolichocephals, while three women and one child were
subdolichocephalic.</p>

<p>We may, I think, consider the two skulls described by Sergi with an
index of eighty, and the one with an index of eighty-one, as belonging
to a foreign element living on the border of the steppes, perhaps as
belonging to the Tripolje folk. If so we may consider our primitive
Nordics as having fairly long and narrow heads, though in this respect
not so uniformly narrow as was the case with the Mediterraneans of
the west. The cephalic index seems to have ranged from sixty-five to
seventy-nine, though more usually from seventy-one to seventy-eight,
while the more typical members of the group varied from seventy-three
to seventy-six. These figures will be found to agree fairly well with
observations made on the tall fair people of the present population of
North Europe.</p>

<p>We can then imagine our Wiros as a somewhat variable race, with heads
which conform to the narrow rather than to the broad type, tall and
robust, though probably neither so tall nor so robust as many of the
modern Nordics. There is reason for believing them to have been fair,
with transparent skins, light hair and grey eyes, though it is likely
enough that in colouration, too, there was considerable variation. We
may well believe that the extremely fair colouring of the modern Swedes
is a later specialisation, due to a few thousand years of life in a
northern home, but we shall do well, I would suggest, to think of the
original Wiros as blonds rather than brunets, though not necessarily
or in all cases possessing an extreme degree of blondness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> Such then
I would have you picture the Wiros on the steppe, and I would also
remind you that many of them seem to have been descendants of the
late Aurignacian and Solutrean horse-hunters, and that they may have
developed the rudiments of their language in some post-Solutrean time
within the Carpathian ring.</p>

<p>We have seen reason for believing that a period of drought, occurring
some centuries before 3000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, drove some of them towards
the Baltic. It is possible, though I think improbable, that these may
have been the ancestors of the group who use Teutonic speech. I am more
inclined, however, to see in them the original speakers of Lithuanian
and the Baltic tongues. Whether there was also at this time a move to
the east is uncertain. Kurgans are said to stretch to the north-east
well into Siberia, but we have insufficient data at present to determine
their age or indeed whether they belong to Wiro culture. It is possible,
however, that the north-westerly movement was paralleled by one to the
north-east, into the Obi basin, and the Wiros may have wandered as far
north as Tobolsk, or even to the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>But the great dispersal was about 2200 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> On this occasion
the drought seems to have been more excessive or more prolonged, for it
is believed that the steppe was left for awhile uninhabited. That the
movements passed east and west is certain, for we find evidence of the
abandonment of settled villages both in the Tripolje area and at Anau.
With the westerly movement we have dealt at some length; that to the
east must now demand our attention.</p>

<p>We have seen that shortly after 2200 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> nomad horsemen
arrived on the Iranian plateau and that their appearance attracted the
attention of Hammurabi and his counsellors. That these nomads, who
were known as Kassites, were Wiros is certain, for philologists seem
agreed that their language was of this type.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> They were the first
to introduce the horse into this area, and that this animal was held in
reverence among them seems clear from the adoption of this beast as a
divine symbol.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> It seems unlikely that the Kassites were the sole
representatives of this eastward move. It may be that it is to this
date that we are to attribute the kurgans found in the Obi basin, or
perhaps they found adequate pasture for their herds on the lower slopes
of the Hindu Kush and the region around Balkh. We are as yet uncertain
whether the group of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> Wiros, who may more properly claim the name of
Aryas, and who spoke Indo-Iranian dialects, left the steppe at this
time or on the earlier occasion but deductions drawn from linguistic
evidence, from Vedic and Avestan sources, and from later Persian legend
would lead us to expect that about 2000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> the undivided
Aryas were occupying the eastern parts of Russian Turkestan. A little
later, perhaps, a group of these, speaking a language which had Iranian
affinities, made themselves lords of eastern Armenia.</p>

<p>These are generally known as the Mitanni or Mitani barons; Professor
Sayce has suggested to me that the name Mitan is the same as Midas,
which would hint at a Phrygian origin, but the Iranian affinities of
their language and the early date at which they appear in the Armenian
mountains suggest that they arrived before the Phrygian invasion of Asia
Minor, while the fact that they were located on the eastern rather than
the western side of the Armenian <em>massif</em> leads one to believe that
their line of approach was from Turkestan or the Iranian plateau on the
east, rather than from Thracian territory on the west.</p>

<p>With the westward move of the Wiros I have already dealt in a former
chapter. Having destroyed the Tripolje culture some passed along the
sandy heaths of Galicia, entering Bohemia and Hungary through the
Moravian gap, and displacing the Beaker-folk who passed northwards
to Jutland, Holland and the British Isles. Others passed round the
south-west shores of the Euxine to the Gallipoli peninsula where they
divided, one party skirting the north √Ügean coast to the grassy plain
of Thessaly, where they introduced Dhimini ware, and where their sudden
appearance on horseback gave rise to the legends of the Centaurs. The
other party crossed the Hellespont, sacked Hissarlik II. and passed on
to the grass lands in the centre of Anatolia. Here they organised the
eastern Alpine tribes into a great empire, and though, apparently, they
adopted the language of their subjects, they introduced some of their
own words and idioms, including the numerals, into that tongue, and most
important of all established in the Hittite empire the worship of the
Wiro deities.</p>

<p>Such seems to have been the distribution of the Wiros about 2000
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, or a little later, and for the next 500 years we find
little evidence of movement, except that the Kassites, about 1760
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span> established themselves as rulers in Mesopotamia. The
great split between the Indian and Iranian Aryas must have taken place
about this time, causing the former to cross Afghanistan and enter the
Punjab, while the latter continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> to roam the steppes of Turkestan,
and eventually to cross the Volga into South Russia, where they occupied
the plain as far west as the foot of the Carpathians.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>We may now for a time leave the Asiatic sections and concentrate our
attention upon those Wiros who entered what we have termed the Celtic
cradle. Some passed into the mountain zone, where others had arrived
before them, and made themselves lords of the settled agricultural
Alpine lake-villages; these were the proto-Celts. Others seem to have
remained in the plain of Hungary, continuing perhaps their former
nomadic life. These, who had spread into the basin of the Morava, became
the Thraco-Phrygian group. Between these two, in the lower valleys
of the Drave and the Save, in Croatia and perhaps in Bosnia, were a
third group, who may be termed proto-Italic. It must not be taken for
granted that from the time of their arrival these three groups were
quite sharply separated. We have seen, however, that the division of the
people of the plain and the mountain zones arose quite early, largely
from the difference between their modes of life. It is probable that
many dialects arose, and that by degrees some of the mountain Wiros
extended to the south-east, even as far as Herzegovina, and these
gradually became separated from the main body of their fellows. The main
group developed Celtic dialects, and south-eastern group Italic, though
both, it must be remembered, spoke Q tongues.</p>

<p>Soon after 1500 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, when the first leaf-shaped sword, Type
A, had been evolved, some Wiros seem to have passed over the mountains
into the Friuli. It may have been merely a raid or a trading venture,
but the Treviso specimen suggests that these swords had remained in use
and had developed into a local type, so that it is possible that we may
see in this, evidence of a small migration of Wiros through the Friuli
to settle in the Veneto. The evidence is admittedly slight, but it seems
to point to the introduction at this time into the regions lying at the
head of the Adriatic of the Venetian dialects, which appear to be more
archaic in form than the other Italic tongues.</p>

<p>During the Type B period, between 1450 and 1400 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, we have
evidence of a northward movement to Schleswig-Holstein and Jutland, and
the fact that these Type B swords continue in the north an independent
development suggests that the party who carried them thither were not
engaged in a temporary raid. I am inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> to see in this movement
the arrival in the north of that band of Wiros, who introduced into
the Baltic region Teutonic speech and the legends and the cult of
Odin.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> As we have seen Wiros had arrived there more than a thousand
years before, but these earlier invaders, I have suggested, had spoken
languages more akin to the Baltic group, and were, if my interpretation
of the facts is correct, the red-haired worshippers of Thor.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> Thus
we get the three groups of people, forming the three classes of serfs,
farmers, and nobles, which are mentioned in Scandinavian legend,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> by
the super-position of the sword-bearing Teutonic Wiros upon the early
group of Baltic-speaking Wiros, who had in their turn mastered and
enslaved the Mongoloid people responsible for the Arctic culture.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>It was soon after 1300 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> that a small group from the Italic
zone, coming probably from Bosnia, passed south and then crossed the
Adriatic, landing a little south of Ancona at the mouth of the Truentus.
Passing up the valley of that river some settled at Batia near its
head waters, while others crossed the Apennines to the valley of the
Velinus and thence to Reat√¶, which stood at its junction with the
Himella. Thence some passed south eastward to Lacus Fucinus and others
north-westward to Lacus Trasimenus. These, as I have endeavoured to
prove, were the Wiros who introduced into the peninsula the Latin tongue
and formed the essential Roman patrician <em>gentes</em>.</p>

<p>About the same time there were irruptions from the plain; the movements
were probably gradual and may have begun somewhat earlier, but direct
evidence of this phase is at present lacking. These people of the plain
advanced into Thrace, introducing there the Thracian tongue and the
worship of Ares; they dominated the aborigines, including the thrifty
lake-dwelling P√¶onians, and made themselves masters of much of what was
afterwards known as Macedonia. Some of these tribes, notably the Briges,
crossed the Hellespont and introduced Phrygian speech into Asia Minor,
in the east of which it still survives as Armenian.</p>

<p>It was some straggling adventurers from this movement who about 1250
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span> entered Thessaly, where, as we have seen, some Wiros had
long been settled. Some may have come from Thracian lands, some down
the Vardar valley, and some stragglers from the Latin group, perhaps,
down the Spercheus valley, having tarried awhile around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> Dodona. These
were the &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; heroes, who seem to have made themselves masters of
the Mycenean city states, groaning under the rule of Minoan tyrants.
A generation later these joined others in attacking Egypt, and it was
their grandsons who, under the leadership of the king of men, sacked the
city of Priam.</p>

<p>The next movement came from the Celtic mountain zone. It was between
1200 and 1175 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> that the Celtic lords, accompanied by the
bravest of their henchmen, left the Celtic cradle, crossed the Rhine,
and passed through the Belfort gap into Gaul. By degrees they conquered
the whole of the country, though they made their mark less in Aquitaine
and Brittany. Others, passing in all probability down the Rhine, landed
on the east coast of Great Britain, and settled in the eastern counties
and in Wessex. It is too soon, as yet, to define the area which they
occupied, but the available evidence, derived from the swords and the
finger-tip ware, suggests the region south-east of the chalk scarp.
Later on a few of these passed across the densely-wooded Midland plain,
across Wales by the upper Severn valley and the Bala cleft, and reached
the gold fields of Ireland. It was some little time, however, before
they settled in any numbers in the land which still preserves their
language.</p>

<p>This seems to be all that we can as yet restore of the movements of the
Q Wiros, though there is a sequel to be added later; we must turn now to
the problem of the P speaking people. We have seen that about the time
that the Celts were leaving the mountain zone for the west, bands of
Wiros from the plain, passing through the Moravian gate, across Galicia
and Podolia, reached the rich valley of the Koban to the north of the
Caucasus mountains. Here they learned the use of iron from their humble
neighbours on the other side of the mountains, who were perhaps the
Chalybes, and made for themselves steel blades for their swords. It was
during their sojourn here that they must have mixed with other Wiros
who were still roaming the steppes of this region, and who were almost
certainly of Iranian speech, which was spoken in this area in the time
of Herodotus, and still survives among the Ossetes<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> in the Caucasus
mountains. They may, too, have come into contact and intermarried with
other folk, who were perhaps not Wiros. For some reason, which I do not
pretend to explain, their speech, which on their arrival must have been
allied to Thracian, changed its phonological laws, and they acquired the
habit of labialising the Qu of their original tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>Rostovtzeff has suggested that these Koban Wiros were the
Cimmerians,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> and since, as we have seen, these P speaking people
appear a few years later in Gaul, and again are found approaching,
if they do not actually reach, the peninsula of Jutland, it seems
reasonable to believe that the statement of Posidonius,<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> which has
received Ridgeway&rsquo;s approval,<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> is correct, and that the Cimmerians
of Russia and of the west,<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> as well as the people who gave their
name to the Cimbric Chersonese are all one P speaking people, and
that we must include in their number the Brythonic Cymry of Britain,
in spite of what Rhys has written to the contrary.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Whether the
name was originally <em>com-brox</em>, <em>compatriots</em>, or not, I must leave to
philologists to determine, but if Rhys&rsquo; etymology is correct, these
compatriots were those who set out from the Koban to conquer the
greater part of Europe. If this be so the statement quoted by Pliny
from Lycophron that the Cimmerii were a people living around Lake
Avernus<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> may not be a poetic fable, as has been supposed, but may
show us that some of the Villa-nova invaders of Italy retained for a
time the common name which survives in Wales to-day. Thus I am assuming
that the words &#954;&#953;&#956;&#956;&#8051;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#953;, &#954;&#8055;&#956;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#953;, Cimbri Cymry are
all one, and suggest the use of the term Kimri<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> for the whole group.</p>

<p>Herodotus tells us that the Russian Cimmerians built castles or
forts,<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> a custom which is found among the early iron age or
Hallstatt inhabitants of the mountain zone,<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> and reached this
country somewhat later in the form of Hill-top camps. Their distribution
has not yet been well worked out, but their date is Hallstatt or
sometimes later, and the available evidence from their distribution in
time and space suggests that they were the work of different branches of
the Kimri.</p>

<p>A large number of the Kimri, perhaps the greater part, remained in the
Koban region until the seventh century, when they were displaced by
incoming Scythian hordes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> who appear to have been of mixed Iranian and
Mongol origin; then they overran Asia Minor as far as Sardis.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> But
many of these Kimri left the steppe almost immediately after they had
developed their iron swords and settled in Thrace; later they moved
up the Danube valley as far, at least, as its junction with the Save.
It was not long before the bulk of them moved southwards, probably
down the Vardar valley, and about 1000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> began the Dorian
invasion of Greece. These introduced into that country iron swords and a
P tongue, which, owing to their having mingled with Iranian neighbours
in the steppe, retained marked affinities with that group of languages,
especially in connection with weapons and other warlike materials.</p>

<p>The remainder divided, the larger group pushing up the Danube valley
towards Ulm and Sigmaringen where they adopted the Celtic speech
of their subjects, but labialising the Qs. The smaller group made
themselves masters of North Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia, and like their
fellows adopted the language of the country, which was allied to Latin,
but with the usual changes.</p>

<p>It was the latter group which was the first to move, either across the
Adriatic or to the north-west and then over the Predil pass into the
Friuli. Though they introduced their culture among the Veneti they did
not supplant their language, but they pushed on across the Po valley,
destroying the Terramara settlements and dispersing their inhabitants
to Etruria, Latium and the region around Tarentum. They settled in the
plain to the north of the Apennines, with their headquarters at Felsina
or Bononia, and gradually conquered all the peninsula except Etruria,
the Greek colonies and the lands occupied by the Latin tribes. It is
doubtful whether these Kimri who invaded Italy were ever known to
themselves by one name, but to others they were summed up as Ombri or
Umbri. Later, as we have seen, one of their tribes, the Sabines, issuing
by night from Amiternum, displaced some of the Latin tribes from the
region around Reat√¶, whence the dispossessed Latins departed towards the
mouth of the Tiber. Here some of them coalesced with Terramara refugees,
who had erected a dry <em>terramara</em> on a hill-top beside the river, and to
this hill they gave the name of one of their abandoned cities, Palatium,
so that it became <em>mons palatinus</em>. Later, when it had been freshly laid
out and surrounded by a wall, it was called Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sabines, who had overrun much of the Latin territory, even as far
as the hill overlooking the Palatine, seem to have adopted the Latin
language, while retaining a few features of their original Umbrian
dialect. Soon afterwards some Kimri from Felsina seem to have made
themselves war lords over Etruria, and to have for a time extended the
Etruscan empire from the Alps to Pompeii, but being a small military
aristocracy in a land with an ancient and advanced culture, they failed
to impose their Wiro language upon the inhabitants.</p>

<p>But the larger group of Kimri had settled by the upper waters of the
Danube and had adopted with modifications the Celtic speech. About 900
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span> disagreements arose between them and the Q speaking Gaelic
lords of the villages in the mountain zone, and no time was lost in
attacking these communities in Switzerland and Savoy, in burning the
pile-dwellings and expelling the inhabitants.</p>

<p>We must now take up again the tale of the bronze-using Q-speaking Celts,
the story of fresh Gaelic movements, but this time a story of flight
rather than of invasion. This was not a question only of Gaelic lords,
for the Alpine peasants, who doubtless spoke a Celtic dialect and called
themselves Celts, were also involved in this ruin. They fled by divers
routes to the north and the west. By the swords of Type G we can trace
their wanderings over Gaul, down the Rhone, the Loire and the Seine.
Others seem to have fled northwards to Schleswig, Jutland, Sweden and
even Finland, to escape their pursuers, while a large party landed in
England, mainly between the Thames and the Wash, and found refuge with
their relations who had settled on the open downs some centuries before.</p>

<p>The former arrivals had been Nordic lords, with perhaps a few half-breed
retainers; the refugees were largely Alpine peasants, unaccustomed to
pastoral pursuits on the high downs, and more anxious for water-meadows
and arable patches by the margins of lakes and rivers. Settlements
were made by the banks of the Thames between London and Richmond, and
doubtless higher up the river. Lowlands were cleared in Wessex in
the Vale of Pewsey, such as the village at All Cannings, and other
settlements were made by lakes and marshes in South Wales.</p>

<p>In most parts of Gaul the Kimri followed the refugees, and drove them
from the valleys of the Rhone and the Loire into the hills. In the Seine
valley, however, the Sequani were left undisturbed and gave their name
to the river. Though no positive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> evidence has appeared, so far as I
know, there is reason for believing that many of these Gaelic wanderers
found refuge in south Brittany and La Vend√©e, and persisted in their
lake-dwelling culture. No pile-dwellings have been found in these parts,
so far as I am aware, yet I suspect their existence; but perhaps the
numerous islets in the Bay of Morbihan were a sufficiently safe refuge
for these poor folk.</p>

<p>The Kimric invasion of Gaul reached at first neither to the extreme
west nor to the north, for its main advance was down the Rhone valley
to the Midi. But there is evidence that small bands moved towards the
north-east, down the valleys of the Meuse and Moselle, and we can pick
up their traces again in Belgium.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> So far direct arch√¶ological
evidence still further north fails us, at least in Hallstatt times,
though perhaps the Kimri did not cross the mouth of the Rhine until they
had adopted La T√®ne culture; but if, as I have suggested, we are to
consider the name Cimbri as a variant of Kimri, they must have reached
the peninsula of Jutland, to which they gave the name of the Cimbric
Chersonese. That they came within sight of the Baltic sea is clear, for
an old name for that sea, <em>Morimarusam</em>,<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> is Celtic. If, however,
Rhys is correct in considering the word Goidelic,<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> it must have been
given to the sea by the Gaelic refugees. In Jutland the Kimri came into
contact with the Teutones, descendants of the Wiros who had carried
northwards the Type B swords. Whether they fought them at first is
uncertain, but by the second century they had made an unholy alliance
with them to ravage the lands to the south, and they would again have
carried fire and sword throughout Europe had not their operations been
cut short in 102 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> at Aqu√¶ Sexti√¶ by the Roman army under
Marius.</p>

<p>It was apparently in the fourth century, or a few years earlier, that
certain tribes of these Kimri, whether a southern branch of the Cimbri
or tribes living to the south-west of the chersonese in Frisia, Holland
or Belgium, is uncertain, began to move southwards and westwards. These
were the Galati, Galli and Belg√¶. They began in various waves to disturb
southern Europe, and to harry the settled communities as far as Asia
Minor, where they survived for several centuries as Galatians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not necessary for our purpose to trace in detail these movements,
except in so far as they affect our problem. In the second century,
or thereabouts, the Veneti, one of these tribes, who had taken to the
sea, sailed down the channel and settled at Vannes, at the head of the
Morbihan bay.</p>

<p>Their arrival seems to have disturbed the Gaelic lake-dwellers of
this region, for about this time we find people, whose culture show
Breton affinities, settling on either side of the Irish channel. In
the lake-villages of Glastonbury<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> and Meare we have evidence of
the arrival of these refugees, and similar evidence may be found in
Ireland, which received its first knowledge of iron and La T√®ne culture
about this time.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> In Ireland these timid folk built their usual
lake-dwellings, and <em>crannogs</em>, in the lakes, though Macalister has
recently seen in these fortified habitations evidence of the arrival of
Gaelic conquerors, who thus defended themselves from the treachery of
their subjects, among whom they were very unpopular.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> But, as we
have seen, the Gaelic war lords, with their bronze swords, had reached
Ireland nearly a thousand years before.</p>

<p>It was during one of these late Kimric movements that the Belgian
tribes began to cross the channel into Great Britain. It is doubtful,
at present, whether the introduction of the use of iron and La T√®ne
culture, which took place about 450 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, is to be attributed
to them, for there were probably many trading posts along the coast,
like the one excavated at Hengistbury Head,<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> which were in touch
with the continent and could have imported these wares. Some of these
settlements may even be earlier than the La T√®ne period; this is
suspected in the case of Hengistbury, and was certainly the case at
Eastbourne,<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> if the pottery found there recently really betokens a
trading post, and not the arrival of a small group of Gaelic refugees
from the further bank of the upper Rhine.</p>

<p>But these Belgic invaders were almost certainly responsible for the
hill-top camps, which in the south of England seem to be earlier than
200 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, though probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> much later in the north and west. To
them we must also attribute the introduction of pedestal vases and other
types of pottery which come, undoubtedly, from the Belgic area on the
continent. Such Belgic movements continued until the first century, and
had only ceased shortly before the arrival of Julius C√¶sar in northern
Gaul.</p>

<p>Thus the Kimri, or as we may now call them the Cymry, did not enter
England until about 300 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, and for a time seem to have
limited their settlements to the chalk lands. By degrees they spread to
the oolite ridge, but it is doubtful whether they had progressed farther
when C√¶sar landed here. The dense Midland forest kept them back, and
they seem to have made no attempt to reach Ireland, or, until after
C√¶sar&rsquo;s time, to dispossess the Gaels of the Parret marshes. But early
in the Christian era civil wars occurred between the tribes on either
side of the Thames, which led eventually to Roman interference, and
it was during the campaign of Aulus Plautius and his successors that
dispossessed Cymric leaders, like Caractacus, fled with their followers
to the west, and introduced into Wales a Cymric or Brythonic speech, the
first Wiro dialect to be spoken regularly in the principality, except
along trade routes and in the small Gaelic settlements above Cardiff.</p>

C<span class="smaller">HAPTER</span> XV<br />

<span class="s5">CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smaller">E</span> have now traced
in outline the history of Celtic peoples and Celtic
lands from the Wurmian glaciation to the Roman conquest of Britain, and
have cited as evidence the conclusions drawn from linguistic science
and an extensive array of data of an anthropological and arch√¶ological
character. Though most of the main conclusions arrived at have been
suggested before, many of them to be subsequently discarded as lacking
sufficient evidence, the main story of the Wiros and their wanderings,
as I have outlined it above, seems to be compatible with all the
positive information we possess, though it is in conflict, as I am well
aware, with many theories that have been built upon them.</p>

<p>My views will not, I feel sure, meet with ready acquiescence from some
Celtic scholars, especially from those who follow Zimmer and Kuno Meyer.
This school has for thirty years been engaged in proving that there is
no philological evidence for the existence of Goidelic speech in England
or Wales, except such as was introduced from Ireland in the third or
fourth century, <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> I do not wish to dispute the philological
evidence, nor do I feel competent to do so. I am ready to admit, at
any rate for the sake of argument, that no such philological evidence
exists. But England has been overrun by Kimri, Romans and Saxons, since
the Gaels are believed to have come, and the absence of such evidence is
not surprising.</p>

<p>I would, however, point out that the absence of philological evidence
of their presence is not conclusive evidence of their absence. If my
equation of the bronze swords and the finger-tip pottery with Q speaking
people is correct, and the evidence from Italy and the Seine valley
seems incontrovertible, the Gaels not only came to England, but settled
there in considerable numbers, and even inhabited the southern slopes
of the Glamorgan hills. No absence of Goidelic elements in British
place-names is proof against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> such positive evidence. A few of the
Gaels may have reached Ireland from the mouth of the Loire, in fact
it seems probable that some such movement took place, though positive
arch√¶ological evidence from the French side is for the present lacking.</p>

<p>Lastly there is an idea prevalent in some quarters that at one time
there was in Europe a great Celtic empire. Some writers speak of this
as though it had been a Gaelic empire. I have been unable as yet to
trace this superstition to its source. I suspect that the chapters on
Brennius in Geoffrey of Monmouth&rsquo;s History of the Britons<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> are the
real foundation for this strange belief, though naturally no-one to-day
would base a serious hypothesis upon so shifty a foundation. M. d&rsquo;Arbois
de Jubainville<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> seems to rely mainly on a passage from Livy<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>,
in which the writer states that Bellovesus and Sigovesus, nephews of
Ambigatus, king of the Bituriges, were sent simultaneously on two
expeditions. Livy says nothing of an empire, and the movements which
he dates at 600 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> seem to have occurred 300 years later.
D√©chelette<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> had dealt with this absurd notion according to its
deserts.</p>

<p>The empire of Ambigatus, if such a thing existed, must have been a
Kimric not a Gaelic power. But empires, if we are to understand the word
in the sense in which it is ordinarily used, need settled conditions,
such as did not prevail in north or north-west Europe until the
arrival in the latter region of the <em>pax Romana</em>. It is conceivably
possible that among the Kimri the tribal chiefs paid some form of loose
allegiance to a super-chief, just as the Dorians, and to some extent the
Hellenic world, recognised, very occasionally the hegemony of Sparta;
but the evidence which we possess from classical sources does not even
imply the existence of any such over-lordship among the Celts. In any
case such vague hegemony could only have existed among the Kimric
tribes, who for a thousand years harried the people of Celtic lands
and the Celtic cradle, Gaelic lords or non-Wiro subjects alike. Before
their arrival the Gaelic chiefs ruled only in the mountain zone, and the
establishment of an empire in a mountainous country, draining into four
rivers and four seas, would have been more impossible than in the open
steppe.</p>

A<span class="smaller">PPENDIX</span> I<br />

<span class="s5">CHRONOLOGY</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">B<span class="smaller">EFORE</span> the days
of written history positive chronology is to some
extent a matter of speculation, and until the beginning of this century
it was little more than guesswork. But the discoveries of Cnossos
provided synchronisms between the arch√¶ological remains of Egypt
and Europe, and since then rival systems have arisen, all of which
approximate more or less nearly to the truth. The pal√¶olithic age,
however, still remained in the region of guesswork, and wild and very
discrepant attempts have been made to estimate its length. It is still
the fashion for some writers to use inflated dates and to count years
in hundreds of thousands, but the trend of the evidence produced of
late is to encourage moderation, and it seems to me possible that the
men responsible for the Fox Hall flints, if indeed they are of human
workmanship, may not have been separated from their discoverer by a
period of time exceeding 150,000 years.</p>

<p>When matters are so problematical, cautious writers are prone to be
content with a comparative chronology, or to speak in terms of millennia.
This method has advantages, for such writers run little risk of having
to confess that they have made miscalculations. On the other hand,
the use of actual dates leads to clear thinking, and to gaining a
vivid impression of the story, and since we have now good grounds for
estimating such dates, (and I shall not be ashamed to own up if later
discoveries prove my estimates to be incorrect), I have adopted positive
dates throughout, indicating where special uncertainty exists and the
direction in which modification may be expected.</p>

<p>While the early pal√¶olithic age is still a hazy past, and the middle
pal√¶olithic is not in much better case, the later pal√¶olithic or
reindeer age can now be shown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> be relatively modern, while the
<em>hiatus</em> between that period and the neolithic age has disappeared.
Thanks to the work of Baron de Geer<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> we have some foundation for a
chronology of this period, and the results of this work have long been
made known to English readers by Professor Sollas.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> There seems to
be little doubt but that the pause in the retreat of the Scandinavian
ice by Lake Ragunda, which de Geer has dated at 5000 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span>, may
be equated, as has been shown by Brooks,<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> with the Daun stadium
of Penck.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> The Fenno-Scandian moraines, on the other hand, can
only be equated with the B√ºhl advance which took place towards the
close of Magdalenian times, and this gives us a date of 7000 to 7500
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span> for Magdalenian. The Goti-glacial moraines seem to
indicate the second W√ºrm maximum, and Sollas&rsquo; estimate for the interval
seems eminently reasonable and has been adopted here; the first maximum
of the W√ºrm seems represented by the Dani-glacial line.</p>

<p>The later dates depend, by a series of synchronisms, on those
ascertained from the Egyptian monuments, and it is unfortunate that
on this point authorities differ. The difference between the various
schools of thought has been well and fairly summarised by Dr. Hall;<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
the two great protagonists are Professor Flinders Petrie<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> and
Dr. Edouard Meyer,<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> whose system has been adopted with slight
modifications by Professor Breasted.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> For this reason there are
alternative systems in vogue for the period preceding 1580 <span class="smaller">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Since so many great authorities, well acquainted with the facts and well
able to interpret them, differ as to the result, one, who is not an
Egyptologist, can decide between them only by testing the application
of both systems in his own field of study. Having applied this test
to both schemes, I have no hesitation in accepting the latter or
shorter chronology, for by the former I find that the earlier periods
would be more prolonged than the evolution of the culture warrants. I
have therefore, throughout this work used dates based on those given
for Egypt by Professor Breasted. This, of course, does not apply to
Mesopotamian dates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Hall would like to add another century or two to this shorter
chronology,<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> and there is much to be said for such a step. I have
not, however, ventured to do so here, but if such an amendment should
prove generally acceptable, it would only be necessary to add the
required figure to all my dates, other than Mesopotamian, prior to 1580

attention to the existence of mother-right in Greece, and he was

Both these authors claimed support from evidence which will not now
stand investigation; a more judicious statement of the case was issued
last year by Dr. Hartland.<a name="FNanchor_527_527"
id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527"
class="fnanchor">[527]</a> In 1911 Professor Rose<a name="FNanchor_528_528"
id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528"
class="fnanchor">[528]</a> set out
to prove the case, but found that his evidence led him to a contrary
conclusion, and he argued that such customs were unknown in Hellenic
Greece. If by Hellenic he means &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo; and Dorian, that is to say Wiro
Greece, I am in full agreement with him, but he includes also Minoan
Crete, &ldquo;because it is just possible that the population was in some
sense Hellenic.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>Rose argues that the existence of the worship of a mother goddess must
not be taken as evidence of matrilinear succession, and were this the
only detail on which we could rely, I would readily admit that the
evidence was too slight. But we have some support from pedigrees.
Rose dismisses the evidence from traditional genealogies, because
&ldquo;many of these are late, and a large part of them is doubtless pure
invention.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> I do not feel
confident that we must dismiss these
genealogies, even if late, so summarily. Much of the detail contained in
them occurs in the tragedians, who gathered it from the legendary matter
current in their day. That there was much more such legendary matter,
and that it was for long after kept alive in the minds of the people,
is clear from the pages of Pausanias. Still doubtless there were some
inventions, in fact it is obvious from internal evidence that this was
so, but such interpolations can usually be detected, and by no means
vitiate the pedigrees for our purpose. Often<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> the interpolation is but
the substitution of a fictitious name for an unnamed son or daughter,
or when tradition states that C is the grandson of A, a name B has been
invented to fill in the missing intermediate ancestor.</p>

<p>I propose, therefore, to examine some of these pedigrees, and will
choose those of undoubted Minoan origin. Ridgeway<a name="FNanchor_531_531"
id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531"
class="fnanchor">[531]</a> has suggested
that the Minoans traced their descent from Poseidon, as the &ldquo;Ach√¶ans&rdquo;
did from Zeus or Ares. There are three well-known families that do so,
the Neleids of Pylos, the Danaans of the Argolid and the Cadmeians of
B&#339;otia; in the two former cases there is ample evidence that those
places received a population from Crete either in the first or early in
the second Late Minoan period.</p>

<p>The Neleid pedigree is meagre and does not help us, but those of the
Danaans and Cadmeians are fuller, and it is claimed by later writers
that the families were connected. The first part of the genealogy is
unquestionably fictitious, and designed to show a connection between the
two families, but it is worth looking at.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="fig_27" name="fig_27"></a>
   <img class="top1" src="images/fig_27.png"
      alt="Pedigree"
      title="Pedigree" />

</div>

<p class="top2">Here we find the late genealogist inventing a pedigree to connect
the traditional families of the Argolid, Thebes and Cnossos with the
eponymous heroes of Ph&#339;nicia, Cilicia and Egypt, and tracing them all
from Poseidon. This seems to indicate that popular tradition believed
all these families and peoples to have been connected, and that they
were worshippers of the sea-god.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the Danaan pedigree. That the fifty daughters of
Danaus were mythical admits of no doubt, and the same is true of their
fifty cousins, but it is possible that tradition is correct in claiming
that one of them, Hypermnestra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> married her cousin and succeeded her
father. They are succeeded by Abas, who is followed by Acrisius, and
then again we get a daughter Dana√´, who is succeeded by her son Perseus.
This hero is said to have left many sons, but here the pedigree gets
mixed. It seems more likely to my mind that Perseus was succeeded by
Electryon, whose daughter Alcmene married her cousin Amphitryon, though
later writers, accustomed to a more strictly patrilinear succession,
made Amphitryon succeed his father Alc√¶us as king of Mycen√¶. But the
times were troubled, the Pelopids were conquering the Peloponnese and
the succession failed. It is well to remember, though, that Perseus
is said to have had a daughter Gorgophane, whose name may well be
fictitious and that her son or grandson Tyndareus was father of
Clytemnestra. It would seem that both Agamemnon and √Ügistheus claimed to
reign not only by right of conquest but jure uxoris.</p>

<p>Hartland has well cited from the <em>Eumenides</em> that &ldquo;when Orestes,
pursued by the Erinyes for his mother&rsquo;s death, pleads that he is not
of kin to her and wins by the casting vote of Athena, the Erinyes are
startled and shocked on finding that even the gods decide against them,
declaring that these, the younger gods, have over-ridden the old laws
and unexpectedly plucked Orestes out of their hands.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>Cadmus is said to have married Harmonia, daughter of Ares, again a
fictitious name for a Thracian maiden. He had four daughters and one
son, but it is not the latter who succeeds him, but the son of his
fourth daughter Agaue. The Bacch√¶ of Euripides seems to show a struggle
between the claims of the priestly or divine son of Semele, the eldest
daughter, and the more mundane and regal son of Agaue, the youngest. The
claim of Polydorus, the only son, does not arise until Dionysus has been
banished and Pentheus slain.</p>

<p>While these genealogies, much garbled by writers accustomed only to
patrilinear succession, show the frequent succession of a daughter or a
daughter&rsquo;s son, it may well be urged that there is no evidence of the
importance of the maternal uncle, or of the <em>avunculi potestas</em> of Sir
James Frazer. This is undoubtedly true, and no reasonable claim can
be made that this particular form of matrilinear succession obtained
in Minoan Greece. But are we sure that there is only one type of
matrilinear succession? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> forms of patrilinear succession are not
all alike. The laws on this subject varied between the Ripuarian and
the Salic Franks, the British crown passes by a rule which differs from
that governing the descent of a peerage, and peerages granted by letters
patent differ from those dependent upon a writ of summons. I submitted
the point recently to the late Dr. Rivers, who told me that it was
his opinion that several types of matrilinear succession had probably
existed and that he had found evidence of two in Melanesian society.</p>

<p>I do not suggest that the evidence which I have cited shows the typical
matrilinear succession as it is commonly understood, or that among
pre-Hellenic peoples &ldquo;the father did not count,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> but it seems to
hint that the succession was in the process of passing from some form
of matrilinear to some form of patrilinear descent. Perhaps it may only
indicate that the eldest child succeeded regardless of sex, but in any
case there appears to be sufficient evidence for assuming that in Minoan
cities an heiress counted for more politically than she did in &ldquo;Ach√¶an&rdquo;
households. It is well, too, to remember in this connection that these
Minoan tyrants were probably Prospectors and that among another group of
Prospectors, the Etruscans, &ldquo;it is, of course, agreed on all hands that
such a system did exist.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p class="bold">Transcriber&rsquo;s Note:</p>

<p>This e-text is based on the 1922 edition. Minor errors in punctuation and hyphenation, particularly
inconsistencies in citations, have been tacitly corrected. Uncommon spellings (&lsquo;developes&rsquo;
for &lsquo;develops&rsquo;, etc.) as well as incorrect spellings in foreign languages have not been altered.
Inconsistent (but not erroneous) hyphenation (e.g., &lsquo;foot-hills&rsquo;/&lsquo;foothills&rsquo;) and use of
diacritical marks (&lsquo;Anchinoe&rsquo;/&lsquo;Anchino√´&rsquo;) have been retained.</p>

<p>The following passages have been corrected or need to be commented:</p>
